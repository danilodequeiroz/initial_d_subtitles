Are you serious ?
With that Mogi Natsuki ?

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,050
Everyone was after her.

33
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,800
She's got such
a hot body.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,200
She'll listen to
anything I say.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,640
I'll teach her slowly.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,270
Teach what ?

37
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,930
You know.

38
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,950
All girls are the same.

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,000

I took her up to the
roof the other day...

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,930
Knock it off already !

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,060
What's the matter
with you, Takumi ?

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,920
Is that the way you're supposed to talk to your seniors ?

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,490
Don't, Takumi.

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,100
You're pissing me off,
you assholes !

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,350
Say what ?!

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,450
Stop, Takumi !

48
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,450
Stop !

49
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,100
A Road Racer's Pride

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,670
You're so mean, Takumi.

51
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,640
How can you leave such a cute girl alone and go to your own world ?

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,400
I asked you if you
have some girl you like.

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,570
I have someone I'm
interested in a little, too.

54
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,700
Iketani.

55
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,800
Hey, where did Iketani go ?

56
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,820
Iketani ?

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,500
I witnessed the incident !

58
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,100
On the frightening Mt. Akina downhill
where a scream echoes...

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,710
...of Iketani in the
third corner, passing out !

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,570
That Iketani went on
a delivery a while ago.

61
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,900
I see.

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,820
If Iketani isn't around,
I guess I have to ask Takumi.

63
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,440
I want you to take a sales
slip to Yamada Trading.

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,200
You can use my car.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

66
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,650
Manager.

67
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,450
You know, I have
a license, too.

68
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,820
Why do you only ask
Iketani or Takumi ?

69
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,100
Well, on that...

70
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,750
Put your hand on
your chest and think.

71
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,270
Do you get it ?

72
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,140
Nope.

73
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,600
In other words, I can trust Iketani and Takumi's driving...

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,100
...but if it's you...

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,830
...my precious car might
come back with a dent.

76
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,270
A dent ?!

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,250
That's why.

78
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,660
Shit, once I get an Eight-Six, I'll become a good driver quickly.

79
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,880
A~~32 !

80
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,950
Welcome !

81
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,670
Cool.
The 32 is so awesome.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,490
N...Night Kids ?!

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,530
Hey, I'm Nakazato.

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,770
A local guy told me that I could speak to the Speedstars' members if I came here.

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,460
Can you tell me when I should visit Akina to see the Eight-Six ?

86
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,930
Don't you know what
I'm talking about ?

87
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,620
Aren't you a member
of the Speedstars ?

88
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,500
Member of the Speedstars ?
It sounds so wonderful.

89
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,650
I guess I came
to the wrong station.

90
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,100
No, you came to
the right place !

91
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,500
I'm the best friend of the driver of the Eight-Six.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,740
Say what ?

93
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,420
We're called the fastest Eight-Six
downhill pair by our team.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,540
Really ?

95
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,200
Well, he's a little
better than me.

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,400
I've never heard that the
Speedstars' skill level was so high.

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Anyway, I can contact the Eight-Six driver you're looking for.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,110
He's my best friend.

99
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,000
Then I'll count on
you to tell him.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,510
Next Saturday
at 10:00 pm...

101
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,250
Next Saturday~~~
at 10:00 pm...?~~~

102
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,350
Nakazato of the Night Kids will be waiting at the peak of Mt. Akina.

103
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,750
``At the peak
of Mt. Akina.''

104
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,140
There'll only
be one race.

105
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,350
Wait...is that...?!

106
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,500
Wait a minute !

107
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey...

108
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,450
I'm in big trouble.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,060
Wasn't that a
challenge for Takumi ?

110
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,860
Holy shit !
How should I tell him ?!

111
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,890
Takumi !

112
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,350
What're you
doing there ?

113
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,890
Don't worry
about that, Takumi.

114
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,100
Anyway, if you're
free this Saturday...

115
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,640
...do you feel like
driving on Akina ?

116
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,590
Nope.

117
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,610
Why not ?

118
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,800
Sorry, but unless I have
a special reason...

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,250
...I won't go
out and drive.

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,000
Takumi, thanks.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,120
Come on in and
have some coffee.

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,100
Okay.

123
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,120
Hey !

124
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,730
This is bad.
This is really bad.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,450
Good work.

126
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,270
Hey, Takumi.

127
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,200
Let me ask
you something.

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,450
Hypothetically speaking, if a Road Racer challenged you...

129
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,800
...you'd race him,
wouldn't you ?

130
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,200
I don't like that,
so I wouldn't.

131
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,910
Then I'd be in trouble !

132
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,450
Why would you
be in trouble ?

133
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,450
Well, that's my problem...

134
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,150
...but a Road Racer has
to race when challenged.

135
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,450
That might be so if
you're a Road Racer...

136
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,320
...but I don't want
to be a Road Racer.

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,750
No way.

138
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,540
And I don't like the idea that I ``have to'' race when challenged.

139
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,150
This is bad.
Extremely bad.

140
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,740
What am I gonna do ?

141
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,880
Two more days
till the race.

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,870
I'll show that Eight-Six guy
and Takahashi Ryosuke...

143
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,560
...that I'm
number one.

144
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,700
Iketani !

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
You accepted the match against the Night Kids of Myogi, didn't you ?

146
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,660
If you did something that important,
you should've told the rest of us.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,590
I don't know anything about that.
What're you talking about ?

148
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,870
What do you mean ?
Everyone's talking about it.

149
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,510
It's gonna be a single match on the downhill between the Eight-Six and a 32.

150
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,450
The Eight-Six and...?
Never heard of it.

151
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:32,100
But they say that Nakazato of the Night Kids came here himself and made the challenge.

152
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,730
Takumi, did you
accept his challenge ?

153
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,480
I don't know about it.

154
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,450
No one knows
about it ?

155
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,250
That's strange.

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,470
Itsuki, don't tell me...

158
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,150
I...I accepted it.

159
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,870
I'm sorry !

160
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,870
Nakazato of the Night Kids
came here yesterday.

161
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,830
Neither Iketani nor Takumi
were here at that moment.

162
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,730
I...

163
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,990
I was talking to him, pretending to be a member of the Speedstars...

164
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,210
...and it just happened.

165
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,770
Why'd you keep something so
important a secret until now ?!

166
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,400
I was going to tell you,
but I couldn't find a chance.

167
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,450
I'm sorry, Takumi.

168
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,600
Forgive me.
It was my fault.

169
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,020
Even if you say so...

170
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,500
Forgive me, forgive me.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,330
Hey, that 32
is here again.

172
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,950
It's gonna race the Eight-Six of the Speedstars tomorrow night, right ?

173
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,050
I'll definitely
come and watch.

174
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,850
Yeah.

175
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,700
Nakazato will challenge the Eight-Six that Takahashi Keisuke couldn't beat.

176
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,800
We can't miss it.

177
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,380
It looks like a match between the Speedstars and the Night Kids...

178
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,950
...but in reality...

179
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,080
...it's a clash of pride between the Redsuns' Takahashi brothers and the Night Kids.

180
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,800
Whoever wins, Takahashi Ryosuke won't just stand by and watch.

181
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,550
Sleepless nights will come one
after another this summer.

182
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Anyway, this isn't good.

183
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
What should we do ?

184
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,350
Since those rumors have spread so widely, we can't withdraw.

185
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,830
I'd better ask Takumi
to drive myself.

186
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,900
But even if it's Takumi, we're at a disadvantage because the opponent's a 32.

187
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,490
Nakazato of the Night Kids is as famous as the Takahashi brothers.

188
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,450
It's gonna be
a tough battle.

189
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,100
It might be a
hopeless battle...

190
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
...and if I think about it,
I just can't ask him.

191
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,610
We can't.

192
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,800
Here.

193
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,930
Hey, Dad...

194
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,980
How good is the 32 ?

195
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,030
The 32 ?

196
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,310
It's great.

197
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,600
Could you defeat the 32
on the downhill ?

198
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,650
I'd win.

199
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,800
Whether it's a 32 or
not makes no difference.

200
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,710
Do you think
I could win ?

201
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
I don't know.

202
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,670
But it'd be
a close match.

203
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,800
Why're you
asking me ?

204
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,420
Are you going to
race against a 32 ?

205
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,000
No reason.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,990
I just wanted to ask.

207
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm off.

208
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,100
So the next
one's a 32.

209
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,220
I guess I have to change the settings on the Eight-Six.

210
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,780
I don't know, but it'd
be a close match.

211
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,160
I had the feeling I'd see you
if I came here at this time.

212
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,540
It was about this time
when I first saw you.

213
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,250
I heard that you're gonna race against Nakazato of the Night Kids.

214
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,500
People are talking about
you all over the place.

215
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,130
Let me tell you that
I didn't agree to race him.

216
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,150
Say what ?

217
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,030
He challenged me while I was away,
and I'm not interested in racing.

218
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,990
What do you mean
you're not interested ?

219
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Nakazato of the Night Kids personally challenged you, didn't he ?

220
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,230
Why don't you accept ?

221
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,050
And beat the
shit out of him.

222
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,620
You should be
able to do that.

223
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,910
Why are you saying that ?
It's none of your business.

224
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,050
It sure as hell is...

225
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,060
...because you
defeated me.

226
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,270
Only the Takahashi brothers of
the Redsuns will defeat you.

227
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,840
Until then, don't lose, even
if it's against the 32.

228
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,450
I said I'm
not doing it !

229
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,200
Besides, I don't
have any reason.

230
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,450
Reason ?
What do you mean ?

231
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,400
Why does a Road Racer
need a reason to race ?

232
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,060
I'm not a Road Racer.

233
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,450
Stop screwing
around with me !

234
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,980
Are you trying
to be sarcastic ?

235
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,570
You must've been driving a lot
to acquire such great technique.

236
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,030
Why would someone other than a Road Racer drive so much ?

237
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,720
I don't mean to drive that
way because I want to.

238
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,500
I have to drive
to help the shop.

239
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,050
Don't lie to me.

240
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,720
How can you learn such great technique if you drive unwillingly ?

241
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,760
That's not it.

242
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,070
You don't understand.

243
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,940
You're the one who
doesn't understand !

244
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,870
How could someone who
hates driving master drift ?

245
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,060
Only those who like to drive can master that kind of technique.

246
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,060
You might not
have noticed...

247
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,140
...but you like to
drive in your heart.

248
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,710
Listen, if you like to drive a car, that's enough to be called a Road Racer.

249
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,610
If you're a Road Racer, you should have pride in the techniques you've learned.

250
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,450
If someone challenges you,
you accept it.

251
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,450
That's the pride
of a Road Racer.

252
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,100
I'm disappointed
I came to see you.

253
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,170
I hadn't realized...

254
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,800
...that I like
to drive a car ?

255
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,660
But that doesn't mean I ``must'' accept someone's challenge.

256
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,080
I just don't get it.

257
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,070
Hey, Itsuki,
where's Takumi ?

258
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,000
He's on late
shift today.

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I see.

260
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,580
Iketani.

261
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:11,590
I'll go to Mt. Akina tonight and apologize to Nakazato of the Night Kids.

262
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,440
Itsuki...

263
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,600
If I beg him, and explain what happened, he might understand.

264
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,190
Originally, it had nothing
to do with the Speedstars.

265
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,750
I wonder if there's
a way to convince Takumi.

266
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,830
I don't think it's possible.
I know him too well.

267
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:35,700
He really hates it when someone tries to force or order him around.

268
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,150
He looks quiet, but once he makes up his mind, he gets stubborn and won't change it.

269
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,200
That part of his personality
is identical to his father's.

270
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,100
He doesn't like the idea of accepting someone's challenge automatically.

271
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,450
That's why he's resisting.

272
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,420
If we force him,
he'll get mad.

273
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,710
When he was a sophomore, he got pissed, and beat up a senior in the soccer club.

274
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,450
Takumi did ?

275
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,890
Manager, I'm finished outside.

276
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,750
Good work.

277
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,300
Well then,
I'm heading home.

278
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,830
Takumi.

279
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,470
Sit down over here
for a sec.

280
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,820
I heard a rumor that you're
going to race a 32 tonight.

281
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,990
Well, I...

282
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,450
You'd better not, because
that's a tough opponent.

283
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,560
Well, about that...

284
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't say anything.

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,620
I understand without
you telling me.

286
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,130
I know all about it.

287
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,550
I know that you didn't
accept the battle.

288
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,100
Itsuki accepted it without
asking, didn't he ?

289
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,120
Yeah.

290
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,890
But you're too nice.

291
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,550
You don't have to save
face for your friend.

292
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,750
I'm telling you. You'd better stay away from the 32.

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,250
You don't know
much about cars...

294
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,250
...so you don't know what kind
of car the 32 is, do you ?

295
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,380
Is a 32
that good ?

296
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,650
Good, he took the bait.

297
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,050
It's far
better than good.

298
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,020
It's totally overwhelming.

299
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,790
It's got a drive train that combines the advantages of both FR and 4WD.

300
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,870
It's so unfair.

301
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,790
The GT-R is totally different from the Eight-Six.

302
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,100
Maybe if the
driver wasn't good...

303
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,790
But your opponent is a
famous Road Racer, isn't he ?

304
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,350
It's different
from what Dad said.

305
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,300
He said it would
be a close match.

306
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,860
Hey...

307
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,500
Are you listening ?

308
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,270
You got famous by defeating
the team from Akagi.

309
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,870
You should keep it.

310
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,810
It's not wise to race against someone you have no chance of beating.

311
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,710
Right, Takumi ?

312
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,130
The opponent is a 32, so even if you don't race, no one will think you ran away.

313
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,540
Run away ?!

314
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,700
Manager...

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,870
...thanks for
your advice.

316
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:31,100
I don't think it's important to gain fame as a Road Racer at all.

317
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,990
So you're not
gonna quit.

318
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,960
I won't.

319
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,000
Having heard how
good it is...

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,570
...I want to see how
good it is myself.

321
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,850
I'm not afraid
of the 32.

322
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,850
Excuse me.

323
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,800
His reaction is surprisingly similar to his father's.

324
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,450
Temporarily closed due
to private reasons.
Fujiwara Tofu Shop

325
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,010
Temporarily closed ?

326
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,300
I hadn't heard anything.

327
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,790
We're poor, so he
should be working.

328
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,860
Damn, the car.

329
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,200
If he's gone out drinking,
it's hopeless.

330
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,180
That shitty old man won't
come home until morning.

331
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,060
If I don't have a car,
I can't go anywhere.

332
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,840
I should've asked
him this morning.

333
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,330
The galleries
are really packed.

334
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,000
There are more people this time than there were during the race against the Akagi team.

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,840
What did they
come to see ?

336
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,580
I'll bet it's
not the 32.

337
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,360
Of course, it's the drift
of the Eight-Six.

338
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,350
He keeps the gas pedal open one corner after another, and they say he's so fast.

339
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,840
I can't wait
to see it.

340
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,050
Oh, I see.

341
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:12,960
If he shows up, could you
