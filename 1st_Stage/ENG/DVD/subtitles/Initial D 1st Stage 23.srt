00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,570
Kogoeta machi ni giniro shita kemuri
Silver smoke in a freezing city...

2
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,270
misugita yume no daisyou
...that's the cost of having an unachievable dream.

3
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,000
Kogoeta karada furikirenai omoi
A frozen body and unforgettable desire...

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,670
accel funde gomakasu
You deceive yourself by stepping on the accelerator.

5
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:56,030
Yoru ni kowareta mama shisen tsuyoku togarasete
Although depressed in the night, your eyes are kept sharply open.

6
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,420
Dareno kimagure kara sekai sae mo owarisoude
You feel like someone's careless act could end the world.

7
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,370
"Break in 2 the nite" It's that time.

8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,950
Obieta me wo shite lost in the night
Lost in the night with frightened eyes...

9
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,610
ochiteku yume ni dakareru
Embraced by a ruined dream.

10
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,370
Kodoku ga kowakute missin' my heart
Scared of loneliness, I'm missing you in my heart.

11
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,080
jibun sae mo kizu tsukete
I almost hurt myself.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,760
Taoreru kurai ni love me so much
Love me so much and knock me out.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,450
subete wo suttee anata wo
If only I can give up everything...

14
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,110
Ai suru koto sae dekitara
...and love you...

15
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,350
kitto sunao ni naresou
...I can be my true self.

16
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,100
Hey, Takumi, you don't
look very nervous.

17
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,560
Are you alright
with this rain battle ?

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,210
I don't know.

19
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,510
I can't go as fast in the rain,
so I'll just drive like I normally do.

20
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,600
I don't know if I can
drive fast or not.

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
I'll try not to
push myself too hard.

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,770
If I damage the car,
Dad'll hit me.

23
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,950
I'll start the countdown.

24
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,860
Five...

25
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,850
...four...

26
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,930
...three...

27
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,910
...two...

28
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,110
...one.

29
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,110
Go !

30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,200
Downhill Rain Battle

31
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,530
The S14 took the
front at the start.

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,510
Although it's a non-turbo,
it's got a 2.0 liter engine. {The AE86 only has 1.6 L}

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,400
It's not only because
of engine size...

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,240
...but he engaged the clutch on
the slippery road very well.

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,360
He deserves what he said
about driving in the rain.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,210
No, the Eight-Six was holding
back at the start.

37
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,790
It's like he could catch up anytime, once they get moving.

38
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,800
He took the
front easily.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,900
This is bad.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,940
He'll pull away by using
superior engine power.

41
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,900
The gap is wide.

42
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,240
I guess uphill is too
tough for the Eight-Six.

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,420
But it'll be downhill corners continuously from here to the base.

44
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,730
Once they're on the downhill, the unbeatable downhill driver's super technique will shine. {Ishimon Entrance}

45
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,730
Ishimon Entrance
Once they're on the downhill, the unbeatable downhill driver's super technique will shine. {Ishimon Entrance}

46
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,360
Once they're on the downhill, the unbeatable downhill driver's super technique will shine. {Ishimon Entrance}

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,250
I don't think he'll
remain behind.

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,240
Hello ?

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Oh, Brother ?

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,700
The Eight-Six and Kenta
in a rain battle ?

51
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,340
Yeah.

52
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,080
That Kenta is so confident
against the Eight-Six...

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,060
...but rain isn't
that easy, Brother.

54
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,290
You're right.

55
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,290
When playing at drift
at slower speeds, he's alright...

56
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,250
...but it's totally
different in a battle.

57
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,150
Yeah, it'll be extremely difficult to open the throttle to the limit in the rain.

58
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,980
If it was dry, the grip
of the tires would help...

59
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,130
...but in the rain, a car's behavior will be very severe.

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,680
They don't run as you like unless you use the weight shift effectively.

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,440
A small mistake will
result in big trouble.{big bang/crash}

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Whether those two know the true terror of driving in the rain yet...

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,250
It'll be interesting.

64
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,870
``Those two ?''

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,300
You liar.

66
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,820
You're only really interested in HIM, aren't you ?

67
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,900
H...help me !

68
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,260
I don't want
to die yet !

69
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,620
Damn, it's getting heavier.

70
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,430
His opponent is an
Akagi Road Racer.

71
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,900
This isn't their home course, so the conditions are equal.

72
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,350
The problem
is this rain.

73
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,480
I wonder if he drives
well in the rain.

74
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,330
I think he must, because he delivers tofu everyday, doesn't he ?

75
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,480
So many times
in the rain...

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,910
That's right !
He must !

77
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,990
If so, his driving technique
will work in the rain.

78
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,580
I won't let you gain on me,
I'll keep pulling away.

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,200
My Q's can outrun
turbos when it rains.

80
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,680
He let the rear slide.

81
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,220
That S14 is pretty
good in the rain.

82
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,360
FRs have a very difficult
time in the rain.

83
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,520
Yeah, even if you step on the accelerator, it simply changes the heading of the car.

84
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,540
Here comes
the Eight-Six.

85
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,900
I don't believe it.

86
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,480
How can he drift
like that in this rain ?

87
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,680
What the hell was that ?

88
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,870
His entry gave
me a chill.

89
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,480
I've got goose bumps.

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,380
I...is this the driving of a man who was lovesick over a woman just a while ago ?

91
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:44,350
He said he wouldn't push hard, so is this normal for him ?

92
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,700
I can't see anything because of the rain and darkness. How can he drive ?

93
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,040
It's too dark, and I can't
see where the road is.

94
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,790
Don't make that sound !
This speed is insane !

95
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,500
H...he's not human.

96
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,550
He's a monster.

97
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm in the groove.
I'm in my rhythm.

98
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,530
I'm in really good
condition today.

99
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,250
The legend of Akina's unbeatable Eight-Six ends today.

100
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,900
Not Keisuke or Ryosuke...

101
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,600
I'll defeat
the Eight-Six.

102
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,850
What the...?

103
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,190
The Eight-Six is
right behind me...?!

104
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,900
When ?

105
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,610
It can't be.

106
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,760
What happened ?

107
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,340
We've only cleared a few corners since the downhill began.

108
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,260
It's impossible.

109
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:39,360
How did I get caught so easily on the downhill in the rain ?

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,850
No...

111
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,240
...this doesn't
mean I've lost !

112
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,530
They're less than
five centimeters apart !

113
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,000
Look !  The Eight-Six's
about to overtake him !

114
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,900
The Eight-Six's about
to overtake him !

115
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,890
He passed him
so easily.

116
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,730
Unbelievable.

117
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,460
It was worth waiting, even though we got soaked.

118
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,260
Yeah.

119
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,090
I can't keep up !

120
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,150
The gap widens every time
we clear a corner !

121
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,870
I can't enter the corners
at the same speed.

122
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,510
What's the difference
between me and him ?

123
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,660
Isn't the rain supposed
to be my ally ?

124
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,610
Okay, I got it.

125
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,940
A report from the midpoint says that the Eight-Six has passed the S14.

126
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,800
I see.

127
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,310
As I thought, Kenta was
no match for him.

128
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,350
Well, he did
pretty good.

129
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,700
Now we know that the Eight-Six
is fast, even in the rain.

130
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,070
We knew that
before the race.

131
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,150
Weather isn't a factor in
defeating the Eight-Six.

132
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,840
So it's Takahashi
Ryosuke's turn.

133
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Welcome.

134
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,350
~~~~~Welcome.

135
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,250
Welcome.

136
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,520
So it's proven that
Takumi's fast in the rain.

137
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,300
He's getting more
like a Road Racer.

138
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,820
He accepted the challenge
from the S14 himself.

139
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,350
His lovesickness is cured.

140
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,710
I guess our
plan worked.

141
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,350
Hey, Itsuki, you
were damn lucky...

142
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,300
...getting to sit in the Eight-Six's passenger seat during the rain race.

143
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,350
It was really scary !
I almost died !

144
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,110
I wasn't sitting in the passenger seat, though.~~I was in the rear seat.

145
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,130
The rear seat ?

146
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,840
Why ?

147
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,900
Dunno.

148
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,540
Takumi said he didn't have
any particular reason.

149
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, I got it.

150
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,050
There's a reason, and
I think I know why.

151
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,220
Really, Kenji ?

152
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,650
What is it ?

153
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,950
It's...

154
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,300
It's...

155
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,470
It's...

156
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,260
Because he
gets distracted.

157
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,950
Don't you think so ?

158
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,250
What if someone as noisy as Itsuki was in the passenger seat ?

159
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,590
That's true.

160
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,560
Oh, I see.

161
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,180
Wrong answer.

162
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,940
They're so carefree.

163
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,700
The reason he put him in the rear seat was as an instant setting...

164
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,150
...to increase the weight on the rear axle as much as possible.

165
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,930
Takumi probably knew it by
feeling instead of thinking.

166
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,920
Thank you.

167
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,800
I wonder how much
more he'll grow...

168
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,930
Takumi !

169
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,250
Who's she ?

170
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,360
Could she be...?

171
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,850
Takumi's girlfriend.

172
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,240
I thought so.

173
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,580
I thought so.
~~~~~~~~Say what ?

174
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,900
I didn't have any
reason for coming by...

175
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,120
...but I was wandering
around and ended up here.

176
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,620
I see.

177
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,850
Am I a bother ?

178
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,370
No.

179
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,330
He looks confused.

180
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,740
This is bad.

181
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,130
I don't want to disturb you at work, so I'll go home.

182
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,370
Oh no !~~He finally got well,
but he might get lovesick again !

183
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,780
Do something, Itsuki.

184
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,010
Even if you say that, races just don't happen when you want them !

185
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,900
Anyway, he has the race against Takahashi Ryosuke next week...

186
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,670
...so he has no
time for women.

187
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,850
Okay !

188
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,830
Hey, Takumi !

189
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,690
Let's go driving
on Akina tonight !

190
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,200
It looks dirty.

191
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,480
Is it because of the
battle last night ?

192
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,150
{kisetu hazure no asa ni kisha ni notte hitori kita e}I head north on a morning train at the season's end.

193
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:53,280
{odayaka na kaze ga fuki tori ga sora ni kumo wo egaku}A calm wind blows, and a bird leaves a trail in the sky.

194
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,100
{mioboe no aru keshiki fui ni toori kakaru basho de}I happen to see a familiar sight while driving by.

195
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,360
{omoigakezu mitsuketa mukashi sunda machi wo}I unexpectedly find the town where I used to live.

196
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,960
{kakenukete iku mado goshi ni omoide tachi mo machi nami mo}Memories and the view of the town pass by beyond the window.

197
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,320
Hello ?

198
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,450
What ?
You're who ?

199
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,700
It's me.
It's been a while, Bunta.

200
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,160
Oh, you.
How unusual of you.

201
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,610
Did you get in an accident and are calling from a hospital or something ?

202
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,010
Knock it off.

203
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,600
Anyway, Bunta, a lot of people are talking about your son.

204
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,380
They say he's
pretty good.

205
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,250
What ?
Next Saturday ?

206
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,140
Takahashi Ryosuke ?
Who's that ?

207
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,650
You don't know him ?
He's well known in our world.

208
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,030
I heard that he's the number
one street racer in Gunma.

209
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,250
My son's gonna
race against him ?

210
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,020
Answer me straight.
Who do you think will win ?

211
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,030
I don't know.
I won't know until they race.

212
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,450
Sounds just
like you, Bunta.

213
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,750
I'm tempted to watch your son, whom you taught from the beginning to drift.

214
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Your drift scared the shit out of me, and I still can't shake it off.

215
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,380
That was a
long time ago.

216
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,740
Mr. Tsuchiya,
you're next.

217
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,670
Okay.

218
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,200
Later, Bunta.

219
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,650
You've improved a lot compared to when you started, Itsuki.

220
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,110
Really ?~~Do you
really think so ?

221
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm glad to hear
that from you.

222
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,200
I've been practicing
grip driving so often.

223
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,480
Okay, for a special presentation, I'll show you a super technique, the result of long practice.

224
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,680
The fantastic heel and toe !

225
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,010
Something's wrong.
I did it yesterday.

226
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,250
Okay, in the next corner !

227
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,240
One more time, please.

228
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,030
W...wait.
Hold on, Itsuki.

229
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm relieved.

230
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,920
I was worried that you
were lovesick again.

231
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,500
Lovesick ?
What do you mean ?

232
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,250
I wasn't lovesick.

233
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,850
But you've been
acting strange.

234
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,980
Like I told you before,
I was thinking.

235
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm wondering what'll happen after I win or lose against Takahashi Ryosuke.

236
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,110
Don't you know
what I mean ?

237
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't.

238
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,250
Don't play riddle games.

239
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,100
Should there be anything
after that battle ?

240
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,280
It'll be okay if there's
nothing after that.

241
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,270
You drive fast already.

242
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,920
I don't.

243
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,400
What're you talking about ?
You are fast !

244
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,830
You've been winning
one race after another !

245
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,420
Is that it ?

246
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,990
I don't know
how I'd be...

247
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,550
For now, you'd better concentrate on the battle against Takahashi Ryosuke.

248
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,530
You don't have much time.

249
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,190
Takahashi Ryosuke...?

250
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,260
Ai ni tsukarehate samayotte ta koro
Being tired of love, I wandered around...

251
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:51,000
Yokubou dake ni kararete miushinatteita
...I lost myself to carnal desire.

265
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,550
Ryosuke, you'll finally be able to test your hypothesis {theory} in battle.

266
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,390
I'm looking forward to this opportunity to present my hypothesis.{theory}

267
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,280
Could you tell us your
hypothesis {theory} in detail ?

268
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,370
Do you know the formula
E equal M C squared ?

269
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,760
It's Einstein's famous
Theory of Relativity.

270
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,850
First, I apply my
own logic to it.

271
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,490
Take E as the opponent's
average speed.

272
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,370
As long as my average speed exceeds it...
