Money can't buy my love nante...
Those who say, "Money can't buy my love"...

We don't notice the lack of love.

Chissoku suru mae ni sakebouze Ho!!!
Before we suffocate, let's yell. Ho !!!

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,890
In the midnight dream.

We smile without dropping our guard.

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,910

It's safe to lie and the truth is empty.

Abunai kurai ni wanna shut and break out
I desperately wanna shut and break out.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,840
Now, we gotta start.~~Let's get moving.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,580
Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,840
Let's dive into the brand new trip.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,560

You're afraid of a big world.

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,830

20

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,410
Trip to the world.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,310
Yo! Here we go unknown world he to
Yo ! Here we go to an unknown world.

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,060
Umareta bakkari no tabibito
You're a newborn traveler.

Narenai ashidori mo mata aikyou
Unstable footsteps are fun to watch.

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,210
Kimeru took dake bashittó
Get things done right only when needed.

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,730
So many people in this world...

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,030
...toki ni chuusyou toka mo nai wake ja nai kedo
...sometimes, you'll receive slanders.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,070

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,560
Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,340
That's our law.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,300
A Hot Wind and Violent Drive on Usui's Mountain Pass

32
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,050
They're fast.

33
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,530
Looks really bad.
Can I make it ?

34
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,800
If they can do it,
there's no reason I can't.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,700
Go.

36
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,130
Next, almost rub the inside.
Grip the road.

37
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,070
Very good, Mako.

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,010
Obstacles.
Move outward.

39
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,350
Not bad.  He isn't
an ordinary Road Racer.

40
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,510
He's on our tail.

41
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,800
Otherwise we wouldn't
have any fun.

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
I wonder how much longer he can keep up with us.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,240
We haven't gotten
serious yet.

44
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,820
This's tough. I'm not
driving in my own style.

45
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm just copying
their style.

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,530
This isn't any different
than a roller coaster.

47
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,330
Because I'm not in
my rhythm, this is scary.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,740
But if I get outrun now, I won't be able to catch up later.

49
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,250
I've got to keep up.

50
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,620
Not knowing the course is a much tougher handicap than I thought.

51
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,950
If I lose my concentration, I'll crash into the mountainside or fall off the cliff.

52
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,350
Just like Akina's
famous Eight-Six.

53
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,340
He won't let us
outrun him so easily.

54
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,550
The terror of Usui, where the corners appear one after another, begins now.

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,900
A right-hander's, next.
It's narrow.

56
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,780
Okay.

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,970
She's fast.

58
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,510
Damn, but I can't
let it pull away.

59
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,450
If they can turn,
I should be able to.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,970
Takumi said, if they can turn, he should be able to, didn't he ?

61
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,680
Yes, that's what he said.

62
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,700
I don't believe it.
What a simple idea.

63
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,360
What's his brain
made of ?

64
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,850
But it's a great
thing, in a sense.

65
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,550
Only a skilled driver like him
would think about that.

66
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,910
Unless he loses control at a corner's entrance, he can control the car...

67
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,840
He should be able to.

68
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,350
But his opponent is...

69
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,560
...Mako and her Sil-Eighty, who knows everything about this mountain's passes.

70
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,150
She must be pushing her
car to the limit...

71
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,340
...so Takumi'll have to enter
corners at the same speed.

72
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,500
His first time on Usui's
unfamiliar passes...

73
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,350
That gives me a chill.

74
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,920
It's scary to
even think about.

75
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,050
Yeah.~~He'll need plenty of guts, not just technique.

76
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,250
One mistake
will be deadly.

77
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,900
He said his opponent
is a Sil-Eighty.

78
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,340
What's a Sil-Eighty ?

79
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,410
He's on my tail.

80
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,730
Why ?~~I'm driving
fast enough, aren't I ?

81
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,750
Yes, you are.
You're in a good mood.

82
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,500
But he's right
on my tail.

83
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,070
Stop looking into the mirror.
It'll disturb your rhythm.

84
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm checking what's happening behind us, so don't worry.

85
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,070
It's just begun.

86
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,610
We have to enjoy this.
It's a great battle.

87
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,490
Okay, I'll leave
it to you.

88
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,350
Right, trust your partner.

89
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,910
You and I are the
best team on Usui.

90
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,000
If the frontrunner runs away from the chaser, the front wins.

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,350
If not, switch positions and try again until the game is settled.

92
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,390
It's a sudden death
death match.

93
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,840
With this rule, you should take the front for the first heat.

94
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,940
Yeah, there'll be a second heat,
so you'll have a chance to practice.

95
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,500
Even if you lose in the second heat,
you won't look too bad.

96
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll take the rear
for the first heat.

97
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,700
Think it over, Takumi.
Okay ?

98
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,250
This is my battle, isn't it ?
Let me decide.

99
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,800
Damn, I chose the rear because
I hate having somebody on my tail...

100
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
...but I didn't expect
it to be this hard.

101
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,570
Takahashi

102
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,910
The most difficult part of attacking an unfamiliar course is...

103
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,370
...the ability to decide
a corner's entry speed.

104
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,040
The reason why
Keisuke was defeated...

105
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,840
...and the reason Nakazato was
passed are essentially the same.

106
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,500
No matter how skilled a driver is, he can't match one who drives hard every day.

107
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,670
If so, to defeat the
Eight-Six on Akina...

108
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,400
I can win.

109
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,120
With my hypothesis, I'll be able to defeat him, even on Akina.

110
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,090
Damn, I guess
I was wrong.

111
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,510
I took a big gamble.

112
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,580
Just a few centimeters difference at the entrance...

113
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,580
...and the speed difference causes a big gap at the exit.

114
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Damn, too fast...

115
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,780
I scratched the bumper.

116
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,100
Damn, I won't
let it pull away.

117
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:04,700
A Road Racer grows by experiencing many terrifying moments.

118
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,100
With extraordinary concentration and trained driving technique...

119
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,700
...and with my perfect
suspension setting...

120
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,230
...he won't lose.

121
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,900
I wonder
what's happening.

122
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,930
Is the race
already settled ?

123
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,790
We won't know
until they return.

124
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,250
It's impossible.

125
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,090
No matter how you look
at it, it's too unfair.

126
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,250
B...but, Iketani...

127
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,950
...so far, none of the races have been easy for Takumi.

128
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,650
Nakazato's 32
was monstrous.

129
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:56,760
And the gumtape death match with that Shoji guy was his first try at that.

130
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,900
But one thing was
always on his side.

131
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,950
They all happened on Akina...

132
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,560
...where Takumi has driven every day
for the last five years.

133
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,850
Senpai, is the course
difference that important ?

134
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,140
It'd be different if he had
driven here a few times...

135
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,910
...but this is his
very first time.

136
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,850
Well...let me see...

137
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,760
Come to think
of it, Iketani...

138
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,350
...I've been wondering.

139
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,770
Who's the girl sitting
next to Mako ?

140
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,530
Who ?~~
Even if you ask me...

141
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,800
She caught my attention, too.

142
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,030
She got in the car so naturally, even though they were going to race.

143
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,030
I don't really know her well, but she's been her best friend since childhood...

144
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,350
...and they've driven together since they were beginners...

145
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,630
...and they perfected
their driving skill.

146
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,990
So she's like
a rally navigator.

147
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,600
If so, Takumi's in an even
more difficult situation.

148
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,860
Don't worry.
Takumi shouldn't lose.

149
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,450
But with a good navigator sitting next to Mako, she can concentrate on driving.

150
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Obstacle before
the corner.

151
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,840
Avoid it and
close the inside.

152
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,800
He's still keeping
up with us.

153
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,120
How can he follow us
at this high pace ?

154
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,800
Mako is in the best condition, but he's still on our tail.

155
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
What a guy...

156
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,110
Mako, C-121 is near.
Let's settle this race.

157
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,020
You can skid from the
entry of the corner.

158
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,190
Let's show him what we can do at the most difficult corner on Mt. Usui.

159
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,900
Okay, I got it.

160
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,120
I'll show him my car skid from the entry to the exit.

161
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,800
No one has cleared the
corner at my entry speed.

162
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,930
Haven't Mako and Sayuki
come tonight ?

163
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,400
I don't know.
I haven't seen them.

164
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,870
I want to see
the Sil-Eighty's drift.

165
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,670
This C-121 corner
is the highlight.

166
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,770
It's really difficult.

167
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,990
It's more than
just difficult.

168
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:47,110
If you can skid from the entry to the exit, you're considered highly skilled on Usui.

169
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,410
If you're good on Usui,
you're the best wherever you go.

170
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,070
Yeah.

171
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,850
You have to enter the corner at high speed with lots of guts...

172
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,630
...or you'll lose speed, and your drift won't last until the exit.

173
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,810
Everyone fails on
their first try.

174
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,270
But if you get used to it,
you can do it, right ?

175
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,720
Only a few can.

176
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Only Mako's Sil-Eighty enters the corner at full throttle.

177
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,100
I don't know how fast she goes,
but no one can copy her.

178
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,850
Someone's coming down.

179
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,220
The squeals are so loud.
Someone's really pushing it hard.

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,750
There it is.

181
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,050
It's the Sil-Eighty !

182
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,440
Mako and Sayuki.

183
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,540
There's a car behind it.
Who is it ?

184
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,320
Are they racing ?

185
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,740
Isn't that an Eight-Six ?

186
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,900
No oncoming traffic.
Let's show off, Mako !

187
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,950
Okay.

188
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,800
Go !

189
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,790
They dove into
the corner !

190
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,250
I don't know
who he is...

191
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,350
...but he must be stupid, entering the corner at the same speed as Mako !

192
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,690
He doesn't know
how difficult C-121 is !

193
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,900
You can't clear the
corner with only courage !

194
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,240
He's got nerve entering the
corner right behind Mako.

195
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,780
Once you enter this corner at that speed, you can't use any tricks.

196
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,250
The middle section of the C-121 is wide, but the exit is extremely narrow.

197
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,400
There appear to be many lines you can take, but there's only one.

198
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,350
Will you be able to stay on that line on your first try ?

199
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,140
Im...impossible.

200
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,510
He cleared it.

201
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't believe it.

202
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,700
Who's driving
that Eight-Six ?

203
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,500
Could that be...?

204
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,040
Could that be Akina's Eight-Six
they've been talking about lately ?

205
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,520
I've got goose bumps.

206
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,050
How ?

207
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,620
The difficulty of four-wheel drift at very high speed is ultra D.

208
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,470
Even with all her experience, Mako missed the entry by five centimeters.

209
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,720
But he controlled the car to follow the ideal line.

210
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,350
We can't win.

211
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,530
We chose a totally outclassing
monster as our opponent.

212
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,560
No, you shouldn't skid
so much in this corner !

213
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,520
You should have told me that before we entered the corner, Sayuki !

214
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,800
What's wrong with you ?

215
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,500
Snap out of it.
It's not like you.

216
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,350
Don't you get
it yet, Mako ?

217
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,230
The Eight-Six behind
us is a monster.

218
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,260
We won't be able to
win with our skill.

219
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,350
Say what ?
You always talk big.

220
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,910
The race isn't over, but
you're ready to give up ?

221
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,490
I don't like that.

222
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,710
Of course not, but...

223
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,350
I don't care.

224
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,900
I didn't know you
were such a coward.

225
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,580
I won't depend
on you anymore.

226
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,980
We knew that the Eight-Six was extraordinary from the beginning.

227
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,240
I decided this race
would be my last !

228
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,110
So unless we try our best,
I won't be satisfied !

229
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,890
How can you have
gotten so timid ?

230
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,150
You're the worst !~~You're like baggage in the passenger seat !

231
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,630
Baggage ?

232
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,800
Yes, you're only ballast, worsening the power to weight ratio !

233
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,700
She's one of those people who changes personality behind the wheel.

234
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,900
How can you
call me ballast ?

235
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,040
I've got a nice body,
and I'm not chubby or fat !

236
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,620
But you're a
49 kg\C5(107.8 lbs)\C3 handicap ! {107.8 lbs}

237
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,490
47 kg !
\C5(103.4 lbs)

238
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,250
Now that you've said that,
I can't stay quiet.

239
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,490
Let's do it, Mako !
Drive like hell !

240
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,290
That's more like it.{what I wanted.}

241
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,160
Turn hard, as if you were going to hit the cliff in the next corner.

242
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,480
Okay, Sayuki.

243
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,000
Wings of fire, tsubasa ni koi no honoo nosete Higher
Wings of fire. We let our wings carry our passion for love.

244
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Higher !

245
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,140
Wings of fire jiyuu ni hateshinaku takaku tobu
Wings of fire. We fly high so freely.

246
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,830
Wing of fire, futari wa speed ageteyuku Higher
Wings of fire. The two of us pick up speed.

247
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,000
I can do it.

248
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wings of fire, hirogaru kono oozora wo kakemeguru
Wings of fire. We fly around in the open sky.
*********************
I'm getting better, even while I'm desperately following them.

249
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,270
I can feel the rhythm
of this mountain pass.

250
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,010
I can drive
in my own rhythm.

251
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,500
There are a few
corners to go.

252
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
But I won't
drop my guard.

253
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,230
I'll push harder and
harder till the end.

254
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,300
For the pride of the best on Usui,
I won't let this be regrettable.

Bunta, does Takumi have a chance of winning the battle against the Sil-Eighty ?

271
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,450
Who knows.

272
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,470
``Who knows...?''

273
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,690
I'm a tofu shop owner,
not a fortuneteller.

274
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,900
Oh, can I have
Gammo and fried tofu ?

275
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,500
It's the Eight-Six
I've thoroughly tuned.

276
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,770
No car can outrun
my car on the downhill.

277
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,440
So, it's up
to the driver.

278
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,530
Well, wait and you'll
see next week.

279
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,690
You're mean.

280
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,280
I'll buy both
soft and hard tofu.
