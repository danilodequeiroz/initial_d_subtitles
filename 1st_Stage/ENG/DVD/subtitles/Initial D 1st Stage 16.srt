So lame !
Your driving sucks !

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,540
Wataru hasn't
improved at all.

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,190
Yeah.

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,420
Hey, here it comes !

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Oh no.

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,920
Hey, clear the road !

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,620
Hurry, it's almost here !

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,850
Watch the best
driver carefully.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,110
Wow, it's awesome.
No one can copy that.

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
Don't worry.
Overtake it.

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,800
We're gonna pass an oncoming car at the exit of the corner.

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Open the inside !

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,330
Next, no oncoming car.

45
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,500
Get 5 cm closer
to the inside.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,560
It's sandy.

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,850
Just right, and you're in
a good mood and driving well.

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,070
No one can
defeat you now.

49
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,800
The Angels of Usui Mountain

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,700
N...no way !

51
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,170
A girl you met for the first time
gave you her phone number ?!

52
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,850
I can't believe that !

53
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,250
Something's definitely wrong.

54
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,450
That's right, Iketani !

55
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,730
Life isn't that easy !

56
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,610
I...I...

57
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,750
A Road Racer doesn't
need a girl.

58
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,900
Besides, it doesn't sound like you if there's nothing wrong with this kind of situation.

59
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,850
What do you mean it doesn't sound like me, Kenji ?

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,790
Are you making
fun of me ?

61
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,850
I don't mean
it like that.

62
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,850
It just sounds too
good to be true.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,850
I hate it.

64
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,400
I don't like your
envious thoughts.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,100
Her long brown hair
that waved in the wind...

66
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,850
Her charming eyes when
she turned to me...

67
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:25,140
God must have sent an angel
to a guy who works hard !

68
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,250
I'll go to Karuizawa
to see Mako tomorrow.

69
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,650
Alright, back to work.

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,510
Hey, why don't we follow him
to see how cute she is ?

71
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,020
Yeah, let's go.
We've got to see this girl.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,160
But what if
Iketani notices us ?

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,850
Don't worry.

74
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,880
Iketani can't focus on
anything else right now.

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,100
Welcome.

76
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,590
I've got to check out
this girl called Mako.{Welcome.}

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,790
Hey, don't get
in Iketani's way.

78
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,800
We won't bother him.

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
When he gets dumped,
we'll cry together.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,810
For the sake
of our friendship.

81
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,940
Gets dumped, you say...?

82
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,330
She can't be as
good looking as he says.

83
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,540
He tends to exaggerate, and
he easily convinces himself.

84
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,860
You're right.

85
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,200
I think it was when we
were in middle school...

86
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,430
We went to
Akina Lake to fish.

87
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,730
We didn't catch anything until I caught a small one just before we went home.

88
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,000
He was so excited,
and said...

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,200
...``It's so big !''
out loud.

90
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,350
It was this small.

91
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,800
Strangers came to see it.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,750
I was so embarrassed
at that time.

93
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,370
Iketani can really
exaggerate things.

94
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,650
Kenji, take a look.

95
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,650
Damn, I was so absorbed in talking,
I wasn't paying attention to my right foot.

96
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,600
I was supposed to follow him,
but I caught up with him.

97
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,020
Sorry, Iketani !

98
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,450
Forgive me.

99
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,200
We just wanted to see
what Mako looks like.

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,850
It's true.

101
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,680
We have no intention of bothering you on your date.

102
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,500
Don't be mad.

103
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,510
We'll turn around at
the next interchange.

104
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,200
It can't be helped.

105
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,150
You don't
have to leave.

106
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,280
I don't mind
introducing you to her.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,310
Really ?

108
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,380
Great.

109
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,850
But...

110
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,900
...don't follow us after
that, or I will get mad.

111
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,860
Okay.

112
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,100
So...

113
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,940
...they're my friends.

114
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,780
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sato Mako.

115
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,790
H...hi.

116
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,280
H...hello.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,700
Well, Mako...

118
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,550
Okay.

119
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,300
Are we dogs
or something ?

120
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,890
It's not a dream.

121
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,770
I don't believe it.

122
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm so shocked.

123
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,390
How could Iketani
find such a cute girl ?

124
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,850
Road Racers don't
need a girl.

125
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,300
Kenji, why don't
we cry together ?

126
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,850
What do you mean ?

127
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,240
Are you saying I'll
never find a girl ?

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,600
It was just a joke.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,710
What should
we do now ?

130
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,760
Well...

131
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,900
Karuizawa isn't the place for three guys to hang out this time of year.

132
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,340
Why don't we go to
Usui's mountain pass ?

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,630
S...sorry.

134
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you have a
favorite car, Mako ?

135
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,190
It's not quite
my favorite...

136
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,500
...but I used to dream
of the previous model RX-7.

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,400
The FC ?

138
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,230
You have
good taste.

139
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,730
You're a Road
Racer, aren't you ?

140
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,850
Well...can you tell ?

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,110
I usually try to drive
like everyone else.

142
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,830
What do you think
of Road Racers ?

143
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,850
I think it's alright,
because I also like cars.

144
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,900
Really ?

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:31,020
Road Racers are better at driving than ordinary people.

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,200
If you have money, you
can buy a good car...

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,340
...but you can't
buy technique.

148
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,250
I prefer someone who can use
technique when needed...

149
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,090
...to someone who has
an expensive imported car.

150
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,650
She's great.

151
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,700
She's my ideal girl.

152
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,390
So this is
Usui's mountain pass...

153
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,950
This is the first time I've seen it, and it's a much harder winding road than I imagined.

154
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,750
It's incredible.

155
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,350
It's one corner after another,
and the road is narrow.

156
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,460
It's nothing like Akina.

157
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,590
I wonder who's the
fastest on Usui.

158
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,800
Umm...you are...

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
Y...yes...?

160
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,500
From a man's
point of view...

161
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,850
...if there's a girl who likes mountain passes, and tries to be a Road Racer...

162
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,400
...what would you
think about that ?

163
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,960
Sil-Eighty ?

164
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Yeah, the blue Sil-Eighty is said to be the fastest.

165
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,500
Don't be surprised
by this, though.

166
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,390
The driver
is a woman.

167
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,200
A woman ?!

168
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,630
Female Road Racer ?

169
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,320
Y...yeah.

170
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,850
I like it.
I think it's okay.

171
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,850
It's great.

172
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,040
A female Road Racer would
be wonderful to talk to.

173
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,000
Is that so ?

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
Yeah.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,250
I see.
I get it.

176
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,000
She wants to be a Road Racer.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,730
And her dream
car is the FC.

178
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,900
A girl driving
a Sil-Eighty...?

179
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,280
What's a Sil-Eighty ?

180
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,230
Is it an import ?

181
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,850
No.

182
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,360
The Sil-Eighty is a 180
with a Silvia front {face} on it.

183
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
A Silvia and a 180 are combined,
so it's called a Sil-Eighty.

184
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,150
And the driver is a girl, and she's the fastest on Usui's mountain pass.

185
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,100
I want to see this.

186
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,870
If you wait until nightfall, you'll be able to see it on Usui's mountain pass.

187
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,490
But don't even think about challenging her, because none of the locals can defeat her.

188
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,670
It's called the
Akina Speedstars.

189
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,450
I assembled the team, and we have the fastest driver on Akina.

190
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,370
He's my junior worker.

191
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,050
Speaking of the skill,
I guess I'd be second.

192
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,850
What's wrong, Mako ?

193
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,020
Oh, nothing at all.

194
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,250
Sorry.

195
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,450
I must be boring you with
all this talk about cars.

196
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,850
No, not at all.

197
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,430
I like cars a lot,
so it's fun.

198
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,490
Really ?
That's good.

199
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,130
Ah, do you think
drift is cool, too ?

200
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,440
A little...

201
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,390
You have to drive hard
like me to master that.

202
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,960
It's a dangerous technique.

203
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,150
Are you good
at drifting ?

204
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,320
A little...

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm happy for some reason.

206
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,390
You are...?

207
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,990
Thank you.
It was fun today.

208
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,710
Ah, Mako...

209
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,310
Yes ?

210
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,550
Are you...
Well...

211
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,250
Is there someone you're
going out with now...?

212
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,250
Well...

213
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,400
Do you have anyone ?

214
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,930
I don't have a boyfriend.

215
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,850
So, please call
me again, Iketani.

216
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,110
Hey, Iketani...
Can you hear me ?

217
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,210
Iketani, get a grip.

218
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,650
I'm...

219
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,260
Why're you
guys still here ?

220
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,220
We were concerned about you,
so we couldn't go home.

221
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,960
So how was it ?
Did it go well ?

222
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,610
Today is such
a wonderful day.

223
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,500
Let's go eat.

224
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
It doesn't happen very often,
but it's gonna be my treat.

225
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,020
And it's not a bad idea to take a look at the Usui guys' driving, too.

226
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,390
I guess it
went well.

227
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,850
So miracles do happen.

228
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,850
Pretty good.

229
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,560
Everyone on Usui
is highly skilled.

230
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,300
Hey, Takumi...

231
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,850
...you'd never seen a mountain pass other than Akina, right ?

232
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,010
How was it ?

233
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,000
``How was it ?''

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,550
I wasn't driving,
so I don't know.

235
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,750
Are you sure ?
You looked so serious.

236
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,780
I did ?

237
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,850
Your eyes looked totally
different from now.

238
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,900
I can't believe they're
of the same person.

239
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,700
What do you say ?
Do you think you can drive it ?

240
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,100
I can't tell
unless I try.

241
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,220
Here it comes !

242
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,450
The Sil-Eighty ?

243
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,700
Nonstop counter drift ?

244
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,220
What the hell ?

245
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,100
She's really good.

246
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,870
See that ?

247
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,090
The road is narrow,
so it looked so exciting.

248
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,560
I talked big and told Mako
that I'm good at drifting...

249
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,990
...but in reality, I panic
when the rear starts to skid.

250
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,850
This is bad.

251
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,150
I've gotta practice hard,
or my angel will be gone.

252
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,260
Let's go down.

253
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,710
Okay.

254
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,680
Every mountain pass has
an incredible driver.

255
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,110
Hey, look...Iketani
is driving so fast.

256
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,840
There are three in here,
so I can't keep up.

257
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,200
You'd better
keep your distance.

258
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,380
The rhythm is bad.
Something's wrong with his car.

259
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,590
Do you think
something's gonna happen ?

260
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,870
I don't mean that something
will happen, but probably...

261
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,960
Probably ?

262
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,200
He screwed up, just
like you said.

263
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,900
Just like Takumi said.

264
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,360
Oh shit, a car is coming !

265
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,260
That was close.
Who's that idiot ?

266
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,850
The rear skidded, he got scared, released the gas pedal, and oversteered.

267
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,850
That's the most uncool spin
only an amateur would do.

268
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,850
Hey, 13 dude !

269
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,000
If you don't move your car quickly,
you'll endanger other cars !

270
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,510
I'm moving it now.

271
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,380
It's so embarrassing !

272
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,960
How uncool.
Let's pretend to be strangers.

273
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,850
I'm really sor...

274
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,750
What's wrong ?

275
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,190
It's nothing.

276
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,290
Usui Mountain's fastest
driver is Mako in her Sil-Eighty.

277
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,770
I feel like
I could die.

278
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,530
He took the day off ?

279
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,510
He didn't even call.

280
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,550
That workaholic, Iketani ?

281
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,200
I don't believe it.

282
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,230
He must've been
really shocked.

283
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,870
He didn't talk
at all afterwards.

284
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,220
When we stopped at a service
area to use the restroom...

285
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,680
...he looked out of it,
and his eyes weren't focusing.

286
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,300
We were so sorry for him,
we didn't know what to say.

287
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,200
I had a bad feeling.

288
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,230
She's too cute to
be Iketani's girl.

289
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,360
After all, Road Racers
don't need a girl.

290
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,350
Lonely driver, Itsuki.
That's my motto.

291
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,950
I hope the shock
doesn't last too long.

292
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,130
Kouichiro, phone call !

293
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,350
I don't want to take it.

294
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,410
Tell him I'm sleeping.
It must be Kenji anyway.

295
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,250
It's a girl !

296
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,820
Sato Mako !

297
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,830
You said you
wanted to talk.

298
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,780
If you're making
fun of me, please stop.

299
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,200
No, I'm not
making fun of you.

300
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,600
I never thought that you'd be the driver of that incredible car.

301
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,400
I saw your Sil-Eighty
drifting at full speed.

302
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,600
They say you're
the fastest on Usui.

303
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,380
If so, you could
have told me.

304
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,190
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,800
I didn't mean
to lie to you.

306
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,820
It was shocking
for me, too.

307
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,930
And I thought I should
tell you the truth.

308
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,400
Truth ?

309
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,480
I'm actually
the quiet type.

310
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Quiet...?

311
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,930
That's hard to believe, because you can perform such a dynamic drift.

312
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,400
You know how some people's personalities change once they get behind the wheel ?

313
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,660
I'm that type.

314
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,680
When I drive fast,
guys don't see me as a girl.

315
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,090
So I thought
I should quit.

316
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,980
I've made up my mind.

317
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,970
I'm quitting road
racing this summer.

318
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,850
For my last memory
of this summer...

319
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,560
...would you let me race against Akina's Eight-Six on Usui's mountain pass ?

320
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,550
That's my wish.

321
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,880
If you make my
wish come true...

322
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,120
...you can have
my virginity.

323
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,420
Wait a minute.
Don't say such a thing.

324
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,970
Am I not enough ?

325
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,570
It's not that.

326
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,200
He's my friend, so I can't
make a deal like that.

327
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,740
I understand.

328
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,760
Her target was never me,
it was always Takumi.

329
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,240
It's obvious.

330
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,940
Otherwise, a cute girl like her would never be interested in me.

331
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,370
Okay, I'll see
what I can do.

332
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,340
Really ?

333
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,900
Don't misunderstand me.

334
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,460
I'll cooperate, but not because
I want something from you.

335
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,970
Iketani...

336
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,130
I just want to make
your wish come true.

337
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,200
It's alright.

338
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
Although it was only a short time,
I was seriously in love with Mako.

339
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,790
As long as she's happy,
I'll be satisfied.

340
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,220
People would call me a fool,
but I really loved her.

341
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,500
Even though it was my misunderstanding, I really loved her.

Car Notes:
Two faces were given to the Nissan 240SX
(Called 180SX in Japan for its smaller engine)
The coupe body with fixed headlights was called the Silvia, and the hatchback body with pop up headlights was called the 180SX

347
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:21,120
Tatta hitotsu kono omoi wo shinjitu da to ieru
************************
A shop came up with an idea to replace the front end of the 180SX with the Silvia one for the heck of it
It was sold under the name Sil-Eighty

Imagine the Camaro front end on the Firebird. Lame, isn't it ?

357
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,150
Mako, how could a cute girl
like you go after Iketani ?

358
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,630
Even if you
ask me why...

359
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,520
And that
shocking comment.

360
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,860
I guess it
was too bold.

361
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,200
There are so
many handsome guys.

362
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,580
But why ?~~How can
Iketani be the one ?

363
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,750
Even if you ask me...
After all, Iketani is...

364
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,910
I don't understand, no
matter how hard I try...

365
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,450
Next time on Initial D:
``Sudden Death Death Match.''
