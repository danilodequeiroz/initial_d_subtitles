1
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,420
Kogoeta machi ni giniro shita kemuri
Silver smoke in a freezing city...

2
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,120
misugita yume no daisyou
...that's the cost of having an unachievable dream.

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,850
Kogoeta karada furikirenai omoi
A frozen body and unforgettable desire...

4
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,520
accel funde gomakasu
You deceive yourself by stepping on the accelerator.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,880
Yoru ni kowareta mama shisen tsuyoku togarasete
Although depressed in the night, your eyes are kept sharply open.

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,270
Dareno kimagure kara sekai sae mo owarisoude
You feel like someone's careless act could end the world.

7
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,220
"Break in 2 the nite" It's that time.

8
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,800
Obieta me wo shite lost in the night
Lost in the night with frightened eyes...

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,460
ochiteku yume ni dakareru
Embraced by a ruined dream.

10
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,220
Kodoku ga kowakute missin' my heart
Scared of loneliness, I'm missing you in my heart.

11
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,930
jibun sae mo kizu tsukete
I almost hurt myself.

12
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,610
Taoreru kurai ni love me so much
Love me so much and knock me out.

13
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,300
subete wo suttee anata wo
If only I can give up everything...

14
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,960
Ai suru koto sae dekitara
...and love you...

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,200
kitto sunao ni naresou
...I can be my true self.

16
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,000
Then I cleared
the corner like...{ DGAAAAAA...}

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,540
I was almost like the
wind at that moment.

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,020
I like the
mountain passes.

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,220
When you buy a car,
you should try `em.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,350
My car ?

21
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,460
It's a Road Racer's dream,
the Eight-Five. The Eight-Five.

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,170
Well, ordinary people wouldn't know about it though...

23
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,850
The Challenge from the Superstar

24
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,220
This year's summer
was so exciting.

25
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,470
Why ?

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,100
``Why ?''

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,100
Because I bought a car, and you swept through the Road Racing world like a comet.

28
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,370
Stop calling me
things like that.

29
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,570
One, two, three, four...

30
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,790
What're you counting ?

31
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,900
Four, four.

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,970
It's the number of battles
you won this summer.

33
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,190
First there was the Redsuns'
Takahashi Keisuke and his FD.

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,950
Then, the Night Kids'
Nakazato and his 32.

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,690
And the gumtape death match
against Shoji Shingo's EG6.

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,660
Finally, Mako and Sayuki in the Sil-Eighty on Usui.

37
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,180
Four wins in a row.

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,960
The legend of the unbeatable Fujiwara Takumi began this summer.

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,450
You're no longer just
an airheaded kid.

40
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,720
It's not
a big deal.

41
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,650
Don't be so shy.

42
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,810
Keep winning, Takumi...

43
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,850
...until I defeat you and
become the fastest in Gunma...

44
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,880
...no, I mean on
the Kanto Plain.

45
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,030
The Comet of Akina,
Itsuki, so to speak !

46
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,000
Takumi, we only have an opening ceremony today...

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,300
...so why don't we go
somewhere this afternoon ?

48
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,650
But I have to
work this afternoon.

49
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,240
You have to work ?

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,650
I want to ride
in your car again...

51
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,180
...because it's
so cute.

52
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,360
Even if it's cute,
it's still my dad's car.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,250
You said you want
to buy your own car.

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,000
Have you
saved enough ?

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,860
I'm saving almost all my money from work, but there's a long way to go.

56
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,070
How much do you
think you will need ?

57
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,440
About one million yen.
\C5(~$9500~)

58
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,800
One million, huh ?

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,650
How much have you
saved so far ?

60
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,860
Still way too low.

61
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,650
Say, Takumi...

62
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,070
...if I gave you 1 million yen,
what would you do ?

63
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,650
I wonder what
would happen.

64
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,860
You'd appreciate it a lot and think that I'm very important to you.

65
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,100
Then you couldn't
oppose me.

66
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,220
You'd quit working and
love me so much everyday.

67
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,040
No, no, Takumi...

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,200
Stop kidding around.

69
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,460
One million isn't the kind of money kids like us can earn easily.

70
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,770
So what ?
It's just an idea.

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Can't you even dream ?

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,620
It's so unrealistic.

73
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,050
So we know that Takumi's technique works wherever he goes.

74
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,800
It's not
just technique...

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,470
...but if he's fast on a
course he's never driven...

76
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,190
...he's got good
natural senses.

77
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,900
He's a genius.

78
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,050
He defeated all those modern high performance machines...

79
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,900
...with a 10 year
old Eight-Six.

80
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,340
It's awesome.

81
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,790
How can you say that ?

82
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,650
Just a while ago...

83
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,360
...you said Takumi would be slow because he had never driven anywhere else.

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,350
W...well, if you say that...

85
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,880
Everyone thought that.
Takumi is unusual.

86
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,440
I thought he'd lose when I heard that he was going to race on Usui...

87
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,580
...against ``Mako's'' Sil-Eighty.

88
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,210
Sorry, Iketani.
My apologies...

89
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,300
Don't worry.

90
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,120
I go by lonely
driver, Iketani.

91
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,640
That's Itsuki's line.

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
Welcome.

93
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,400
Flowers ?

94
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,300
You must be mistaken.

95
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,000
This is a
gas station...

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,030
Takumi, these are for you.

97
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,130
Who from ?

98
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,630
From Takahashi Ryosuke.

99
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,850
Takahashi...

100
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,180
...Ryosuke.

101
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,650
From Gunma's number one
superstar to Takumi...?!

102
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,550
What does it say ?
Let me read it.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,790
September 15, 10:00pm.
At Mt. Akina's peak.

104
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,470
Hey, that's all it says ?

105
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,010
B...but that's...

106
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:32,780
Finally, Takahashi Ryosuke has sent him a challenge for a downhill battle.

107
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,180
Takumi, what'll you do ?

108
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,630
Whatever the outcome might be,
he should accept it !

109
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,520
Speaking of the Redsuns, his brother, Takahashi Keisuke, was defeated by Takumi !

110
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,650
Right.

111
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,370
If you refuse this rematch,
it'll be more disgraceful than losing.

112
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,360
What's wrong, Takumi ?

113
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,060
Aren't you having
fun with me ?

114
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,470
I...it's not that.

115
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,100
But you don't
look very interested.

116
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,000
You look out of it.

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,990
Well, that's
nothing new, but...

118
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,950
You look like your
mind isn't here.

119
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,730
If you aren't having fun,
I'm going home.

120
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,100
I am having fun.

121
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,850
Sorry, I apologize.

122
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,500
Then tell me what
you were thinking.

123
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,930
I won't forgive
you unless you do.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,200
It would be difficult for you to understand even if I told you.

125
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,930
I'm going home !

126
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,690
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you.

127
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,890
``Battle ?''

128
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,980
Are you going
to fight someone ?

129
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,580
No.  We just call
a car race a ``battle.''

130
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,300
Car race ?

131
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,000
I didn't know you
liked that kind of thing.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,540
I didn't intend liking it.
I was kinda dragged into it.

133
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,390
And my next opponent's
very good and famous.

134
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,660
I haven't been able to help thinking about it since this morning.

135
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,040
I guess this
is pressure.

136
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,190
You're good at driving,
so you'll be okay.

137
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,550
It's not that easy.

138
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,300
If you don't like it,
why don't you ignore him ?

139
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,310
It's not that
I don't like it.

140
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm not going to run away, although
I don't know if I can win.

141
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,300
That's just like you.

142
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,890
You want to race deep in
your heart, don't you ?

143
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,680
You look calm, but at the bottom of your heart, you absolutely hate to lose.

144
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,970
I don't dislike that
type of personality.

145
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,520
Let's go home.

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,300
Hey, a little longer...

147
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,130
Why don't we talk
a little longer ?

148
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,650
Umm, I know why...

149
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,400
...you fought the soccer club senior classman in the locker room.

150
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,850
After you quit the club, one of the members quietly told me.

151
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,400
You got angry
because of me.

152
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,780
I'm sorry I didn't understand you for such a long time.

153
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,700
It's okay.~~It doesn't
mean anything now.

154
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,170
That's Takumi's Eight-Six.

155
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,960
W...who's that girl ?

156
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,020
Wha...?

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,020
Tsuchiya Keiichi's
drift is incredible.

158
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,290
Look at these
sequential photos, Takumi.

159
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,780
Takumi.
Hey, Takumi.

160
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,040
What is it, Itsuki ?
Is it lunch time already ?

161
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,670
You idiot !

162
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,790
It's nothing.
I'm just talking to myself.

163
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,560
Takumi's been acting strangely for the past few days ?

164
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,750
How strange is he ?

165
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,650
He's out of it, and...

166
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,350
That's not unusual.

167
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,250
Well, true...

168
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,910
...but he wasn't that way
during summer break.

169
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:52,070
But since school started, he looks even worse than before.

170
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,650
I wonder if it's fatigue
from constant battles.

171
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,650
It was his first experience, so he might've lost tension after school started.

172
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,650
That's not quite right.

173
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,670
It's almost like
he's brainless.

174
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey, do you think he can race against Takahashi Ryosuke ?

175
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,600
Takumi has a girlfriend,
doesn't he ?

176
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Why'd you ask
that so suddenly ?

177
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,880
Well, I thought he could
be lovesick over a girl.

178
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,920
Lovesick over a girl ?

179
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,700
Yeah.

180
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,830
You were like that when you were with Mako, remember ?

181
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,650
Kenji, it's taboo to
mention her name here.

182
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,650
It's alright, Itsuki.

183
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,750
And I saw Takumi and a
girl in his Eight-Six.

184
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,000
IS THAT TRUE ?!

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,220
I only glanced at her,
but she was cute.

186
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,820
Could Takumi's
girlfriend be...?!

187
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,050
No wonder he stopped
going home with me.

188
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,280
That jerk...
I won't forgive you.

189
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,780
I haven't even been
able to touch her hand !

190
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,600
That's it.
That's the reason.

191
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,500
It must be !

192
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,820
Leave it to me !

193
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,540
I'll drag him out
and ask him tonight !

194
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,740
Road Racers don't need
girls, right, Iketani ?

195
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,880
Right !

196
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,620
We're lonely drivers !

197
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,440
So pathetic...

198
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,150
What do you want
to talk about ?

199
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:09,060
You've been going out with Mogi without telling me, haven't you ?

200
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,370
Oh, that ?

201
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,850
``That ?!''

202
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,930
I didn't think it was
something I had to tell you.

203
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,150
No excuses !
Answer my question !

204
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,240
H...how far have
you gone ?

205
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,200
How far have you gone
with Mogi ?~~Be honest.

206
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,870
``How far...?''

207
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,690
If you're my best friend,
tell me honestly !

208
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,280
Itsuki, look ahead,
look ahead !

209
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,390
I'll tell you !
I'll tell you !

210
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,980
Go ahead.

211
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,390
Last Sunday...

212
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,420
``Last Sunday.''

213
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,030
The two of us...

214
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,000
``T...Two of us...''

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,960
...went to Lake Akina.

216
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,070
Hey...Itsuki !
Look, look !

217
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,150
That's not what
I'm asking.

218
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,310
It's about going from A to B to C !
You're really an idiot.

219
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,300
``A to B...?''

220
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,880
D...did you kiss ?

221
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,950
Yeah.

222
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,310
Say what ?!

223
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,470
Hey, Itsuki, stop !
Stop !

224
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,560
It must be
because of a girl.

225
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,740
What're you looking at ?

226
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,100
You've been acting
strange lately.

227
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,930
Have I ?

228
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,220
It's not like you to think so much,
but you've been thinking a lot lately.

229
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,380
Yeah, you're right.

230
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,920
He must be preoccupied,
recalling the kiss with Mogi.

231
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,950
I'm wondering what'll
happen in the future.

232
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,300
In the future ?!

233
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,060
After a kiss means...

234
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,650
How dare you say such a dirty thing in front of a lonely driver !

235
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,000
I know what happens
after a kiss !

236
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,010
What ?
What do you mean ?

237
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,290
There's only one thing !

238
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,000
What're you talking about ?

239
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,060
We aren't talking
about the same thing.

240
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,430
What I mean
by the future...

241
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,650
Oh, whatever.

242
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,160
I don't like to think
about difficult matters.

243
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,340
I guess his lovesickness can't
be cured so easily.

244
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,300
I was wondering
who that was...

245
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,380
...but that's Keisuke's FD
and Kenta's S14.

246
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,900
Kenta's fast
on the downhill.

247
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,240
His car's grade is Q's with a non-turbo,
so his specialty is downhill.

248
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,240
He's been recognized by Keisuke,
and being trained by him.

249
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,970
If he's being personally taught
by our team's number two...

250
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,960
But there's a race against the
Night Kids the day after tomorrow.

251
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,650
I wonder if he should be
messing around with Kenta.

252
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,100
I guess he's got
time to spare.

253
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,570
So Nakazato Takeshi is going
to be out of his league.

254
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,100
He's been in good
condition lately.

255
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,770
Hey, don't you think his driving style has gotten similar to Ryosuke's ?

256
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,790
Yes, it has.
I think so, too.

257
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:04,100
I guess Ryosuke trusts
Keisuke completely.

258
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,650
That's why he won't
show up on Myogi.

259
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,810
Keisuke, can I ask
you something ?

260
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,180
What is it ?

261
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,310
Why're you leaving
Akina's Eight-Six alone ?

262
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,210
Why don't you drag him to
Akagi for a return match ?

263
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,560
To Akagi ?

264
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,250
That's right.

265
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,500
You're familiar with the course, so you couldn't be defeated by a mere Eight-Six !

266
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,990
If you don't...

267
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,710
...I will !

268
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,760
You'd better not, Kenta.

269
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,880
Why not ?

270
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,320
Do you think I'd lose ?

271
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,190
If it's Akagi's downhill,
I'd be able to...

272
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,870
That's not the issue.

273
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,350
You're a member of the Redsuns,
so you should know better.

274
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,040
It's our policy to defeat opponents on their home course.

275
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,650
It's true, but...

276
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,340
...Keisuke, I can't stand the fact that we lost to the Eight-Six !

277
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,100
If it's neither of our home courses,
the conditions will be equal !

278
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,750
Let me...
Let me do it !

279
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,840
Don't be so hasty !

280
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,650
Don't worry.

281
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,650
When it's time
to do it...

282
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,080
...there's a person
who'll do it right.

283
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,920
So, Ryosuke
will finally...

284
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,250
Don't be hasty.~~We have a race with the Night Kids first.

285
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,490
Leave it to us.

286
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,340
Something's wrong
with him, after all.

287
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,300
See ?
He confessed.

288
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,180
It's a girl
after all.

289
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,210
We have to do something.

290
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,000
We only have one week before the battle against Takahashi Ryosuke.

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,840
This is really bad.

292
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,360
Ai ni tsukarehate samayotte ta koro
Being tired of love, I wandered around...

What's so bad, Itsuki ?

309
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,350
The battle against
Takahashi Ryosuke is soon...

310
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,640
No time to
think about that.

311
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,030
Takumi is lovesick over a girl at an important time like this.

312
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,980
Lovesick over a girl.

313
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:49,650
He must have done this and that and something really (bleep) !

314
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,810
Oh, not that again.

315
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,700
