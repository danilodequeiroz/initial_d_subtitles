26

30
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,489
That's our law.

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,010
Sonuva...

32
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,610
Hey, you're the one !

33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,961
You hit my car from
behind, didn't you ?!

34
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:52,281
Gimme a break.
It was your fault.

35
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,061
Say what ?

36
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:56,952
You were so slow, I couldn't
predict your actions.

37
00:01:56,952 --> 00:02:00,362
I didn't expect you to
enter the corner so slowly.

38
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:04,263
I couldn't brake in time,
and I touched your tail.

39
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:05,483
How dare you !

40
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,733
Stop, Iketani !

41
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:12,664
If you want me to apologize,
we'll race by our rules...

42
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:15,864
...and if you win, I'll
kneel down to the ground.

43
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:19,215
By your rules ?
What do you mean ?

44
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:21,365
It's not so difficult.

45
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:24,156
We call it a
gumtape death match.

46
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,576
Gumtape death match ?

47
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:32,717
I heard that there's a fast Eight-Six downhill driver in the Speedstars.

48
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:39,138
Tell the Eight-Six brat that I'll be waiting here at 10:00pm next Saturday.

49
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:41,318
Catch ya later.

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,331
What's with him ?
He challenged Takumi.

51
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,421
But he doesn't
know Takumi's face.

52
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,422
Takumi, take his challenge, whether it's a gumtape death match or not !

53
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:12,072
Defeat the guy,
and make him kneel down !

54
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,352
Don't be stupid.
It's too risky, Itsuki.

55
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:16,083
He won't be able to
steer during the race.

56
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:20,473
But, Iketani, Takumi has defeated the FD and 32 !

57
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:23,294
He won't lose just because
of some customized rule !

58
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:27,264
Idiot, that guy must've practiced a lot under that rule.

59
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:31,975
Takumi, don't race at such
a disadvantage, no matter what.

60
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:38,036
I don't have any
intention of racing.

61
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:41,926
Yeah, that's good.
Just ignore him.

62
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:48,677
Itsuki's First Date

63
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,350
What ?
A gumtape death match ?

64
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,090
Yes.

65
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,020
That's ridiculous.
And what about Takumi ?

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,151
He's calm and
uninterested like usual.

67
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,501
He doesn't
feel like racing.

68
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:22,242
I want Takumi to race.

69
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:27,562
He'll outrun that jerk, make him kneel down, and we'll feel great !

70
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:31,983
He's driving a Civic, the
archrival of Levins and Truenos !

71
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:39,284
Yeah, when we were young,
we used gears and rules...

72
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:44,425
...but the gumtape death match was one of the most dangerous battles.

73
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:48,035
Is a gumtape death match really that dangerous ?

74
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,915
I don't quite get it.

75
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,536
Itsuki, get in your
car and give it a try.

76
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:54,786
Then you'll see.

77
00:04:58,637 --> 00:04:59,537
Well...

78
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:04,827
Okay, steer full to either left or right, while keeping your right hand on the steering wheel.

79
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:05,588
O...okay.

80
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,268
I can't turn
any farther.

81
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:15,339
Okay, leave the steering wheel as it is and get out of the car.

82
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,189
Okay.

83
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,869
Now see how
far you steered.

84
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:19,709
O...okay.

85
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,550
It only turned that much ?!
I thought I steered a lot.

86
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,991
See ?

87
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:30,891
How would you turn
in the corners ?

88
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,931
You couldn't drive
in the mountain passes.

89
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:36,042
You can only use steering
to initiate the turn.

90
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:39,592
You must slide the rear
tires to clear the corners.

91
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:41,232
All of them.

92
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:46,193
But Takumi's good at drifting,
so he'll be able to pull it off.

93
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:48,113
It's not that easy.

94
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:53,044
He can't countersteer, which
makes drift control difficult.

95
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:56,514
If he oversteers a bit,
he'll go into a spin.

96
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:01,055
But if he understeers at the entrance, it'll be over.

97
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:04,976
This rule gives
FF cars an advantage.

98
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,586
The opponent is
an EG6, right ?

99
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:08,066
Yes.

100
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,796
Since the EG6 has an FF layout...

101
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:12,297
...he can cope with oversteering using the gas pedal, so he can enter corners fast...

102
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:16,047
...and he can also minimize the ``under'' by using the parking brake.

103
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,747
In order for an FR like
the Eight-Six to race safely...

104
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,648
...just like a circus
tightrope walker...

105
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:24,778
...he has to drift throughout the race and maintain extreme control.

106
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:27,649
He'd better not do it.

107
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:34,160
Damn, if he heard that,
he might become interested.

108
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,660
Umm, Manager...

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,531
Hey, it's Kenji.

110
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:48,452
Iketani, it's about that
jerk from the other day.

111
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:50,352
I did a little
investigating.

112
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:53,572
He's Shoji Shingo of
the Myogi Night Kids.

113
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:55,873
Shoji Shingo of
the Night Kids...?

114
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,553
He's supposed to
be their number two...

115
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:04,254
...but he claims to be the fastest of the Night Kids on the downhill.

116
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,654
But he doesn't choose normal means to accomplish his goal...

117
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:09,324
...so the other members
don't trust him.

118
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:13,145
He especially doesn't get along with their leader, Nakazato Takeshi.

119
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,055
I see.

120
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:19,186
So he wants to defeat Takumi to gain influence in the Night Kids.

121
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:23,056
He's going around
spreading a nasty rumor.

122
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,236
What ?
A rumor...?

123
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,457
Yeah.

124
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:29,407
``The Speedstars are scared, and we won't accept his challenge.''

125
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,787
It doesn't say anything about it being a gumtape death match.

126
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:34,498
So we're the only
ones who'll look bad.

127
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:37,028
What an asshole.

128
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,258
Yeah.

129
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,369
He's trying to drag Takumi
into racing him, no matter what.

130
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,409
Takumi...

131
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,660
Me...?

132
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,680
Means nothing to me.
I won't accept his challenge.

133
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
That's good.

134
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,921
Even if you've been challenged, it's too ridiculous to accept.

135
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,051
Don't sweat it.

136
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:00,671
O...okay.

137
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,212
So, what about the battle
with the Eight-Six ?

138
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,313
I'm ready any time.

139
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:13,663
It's their move now.

140
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:14,663
Wait and see.

141
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:18,274
I'll drag that
Eight-Six brat out.

142
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,664
It'll be an
interesting battle.

143
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,925
Takeshi...

144
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:28,775
Shingo, you seem to
be planning something.

145
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,715
I don't care
what you do...

146
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:34,646
...just don't disgrace the name of the Night Kids, okay ?

147
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,347
What's so funny ?

148
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:43,227
Aren't you the one who's disgraced our name already ?

149
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:44,837
Say what ?

150
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:50,008
Who was the one who was totally outrun by a brat in a dated Eight-Six ?

151
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:52,418
And in a high
powered 32, at that ?

152
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,129
Shingo...

153
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:58,049
A loser should go
bark somewhere else.

154
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:03,020
I don't want you preaching to me as if you'll be our leader forever.

155
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,220
Nakazato, I'll avenge you.

156
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,501
You should
thank me.

157
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:20,592
Shingo, you'll eventually see how great the Eight-Six is.

158
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:28,743
Man, Takeshi is
on the way out.

159
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,944
Really, he was so lame.

160
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:35,024
From now on, the leader of the Night Kids is you, Shingo.

161
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:42,195
Before that, I'll send Akina's
Eight-Six to the junkyard.

162
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:03,428
Hello, this
is Takeuchi...

163
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:05,578
Is this Saori ?

164
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:08,229
Oh, Itsuki...?

165
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:12,059
Sure, I remember you.

166
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,020
Go driving to
Akina Lake ?

167
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,290
Okay.

168
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,811
I'll be waiting at
the bus stop at 1:00pm.

169
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,801
Yeah.~~Bye.

170
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,282
Alright !

171
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:33,402
My 18 years of life without
a girlfriend is finally over !

172
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:36,263
I'll do it !

173
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:54,845
Here.

174
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,696
Oh, Dad...

175
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:01,726
What ?

176
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,696
Is a gumtape
death match...

177
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,957
Nothing.
Never mind.

178
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:21,219
Gumtape death match, huh ?

179
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,040
You're so...

180
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:37,201
...good at driving.

181
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:48,092
I don't mind staying
overnight if it's with you.

182
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,643
I think of her a lot.

183
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,036
Thank you very much !

184
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,907
Where's Itsuki ?

185
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,697
He was washing
a car a while ago.

186
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,678
I wonder
where he went.

187
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,538
I see, I see.

188
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,149
So...

189
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:35,999
...you're neglecting work
in a place like this.

190
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,099
I...I'm just
taking a break.

191
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:42,740
It's unusual to
see you reading.

192
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
T...that's...

193
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,700
Let's see...

194
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,471
Love manual ?
How to romance a girl ?

195
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:51,181
Well, that's...

196
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:56,312
Reading a book
like this means...

197
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:57,702
...you've got a date ?

198
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:58,932
Y...yes.

199
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:03,743
With that babe, Saori,
you talked about ?

200
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,243
How dare you
get ahead of me !

201
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:11,014
I bought the book on the way home yesterday, and I've been studying hard.

202
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:14,504
When it comes to things like this, I don't think I can depend on you.

203
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:18,315
You're straightforward. It can't be helped because it's true.

204
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:22,705
Things are so
convenient these days.

205
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,956
We had to find out everything
by ourselves in my time.

206
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:27,156
Let me see...

207
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:31,756
``It's an established fact, to get close to a girl by the third date...''

208
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:35,817
``...create a romantic mood
for the first kiss...''

209
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,137
I'm perfectly
prepared, Manager.

210
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:43,198
So I'm taking a day off,
like I told you earlier.

211
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,649
So that's what it's all about.
I guess it's alright.

212
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,259
I'm envious of you !

213
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,952
This is it.

214
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,322
Saori...?

215
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,703
Over here, Itsuki !

216
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,615
Gorgeous.

217
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,176
Welcome...

218
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,368
I don't need any gas.

219
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:57,408
I want to hear your answer
about the gumtape death match.

220
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:00,229
You told the Eight-Six
guy about it, didn't you ?

221
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,519
Yeah.

222
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,719
He has no intention
of racing you.

223
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,399
That's what he said.

224
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,520
That's funny.

225
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,560
Akina's Eight-Six
driver is a coward.

226
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,450
The gumtape death match
scared him off, huh ?

227
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,071
That doesn't matter.

228
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:18,281
I'll do anything
to make him race.

229
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,135
So cute.

230
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:53,004
We Road Racers don't say, ``turn into the curve,'' we say, ``tackle the corner.''

231
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,465
I want to
get a license.

232
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,425
Why don't you ?
I'll teach you how.

233
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:03,435
Okay, I'll think about it.

234
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:11,176
Akina Fuji.
It's so beautiful.

235
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:18,657
``Girls react to the mood.
Do the first kiss in a romantic setting.''

236
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:22,608
First kiss...

237
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:29,289
It's the right chance.
Go for it, Itsuki !

238
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,132
Itsuki !

239
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,895
I'm sorry.

240
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:35,018
The mood is heavy.
I'm in trouble.

241
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,140
Found you.

242
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,751
An EG6...

243
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,462
He tapped my bumper.

244
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:05,892
Does it mean I should
get out of the way ?

245
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:17,554
He's right on my butt.

246
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,774
Shit, I have to be decisive
in front of Saori.

247
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:25,255
Saori, I'm gonna
speed up a little bit.

248
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:27,095
Please bear with it
for a while, okay ?

249
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:42,407
Itsuki, stop !

250
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:45,567
It's a battle
between Road Racers !

251
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,978
I can't stop !

252
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,874
At...at least Saori...

253
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,166
Hey, we have
a problem !

254
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,876
Itsuki had
an accident !

255
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:49,736
Where ?

256
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:53,137
On Akina's mountain pass !
He was taken to the city hospital !

257
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,927
You two go
check on him !

258
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:55,707
Right.

259
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:01,818
Are you alright, Itsuki ?

260
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:04,408
Senpai, Takumi.

261
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:06,458
What happened ?

262
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,419
They're overreacting.

263
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,419
It's not as
bad as it looks...

264
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,520
...but they're keeping
me here to be sure.

265
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,200
What about Saori ?
She was with you, wasn't she ?

266
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,850
She only got a scratch,
so she went home already.

267
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,081
I steered hard so I wouldn't
crush the passenger side.

268
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,221
What happened
to the car...

269
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,061
...your Eight-Five ?

270
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:31,482
It spun just right, so it only
suffered minor damage to the trunk.

271
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:33,372
It's done.

272
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,592
Take care.

273
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,172
Thank you.

274
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:48,084
I was going downhill on Akina,
and an EG6 tailgated me.

275
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,774
An EG6 ?

276
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:51,045
Him again ?

277
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:54,915
Probably, because
it was a red EG6.

278
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:58,135
I was suddenly bumped
from behind in a corner.

279
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:01,626
That asshole
did it again.

280
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,126
Shit.

281
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:04,566
I'll do it !

282
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,627
Whether it's a gumtape death
match or not, I'll do it !

283
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,817
Takumi, wait !

284
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:12,477
Takumi...

285
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:14,568
Sorry.

286
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,128
Don't be taken in
by his strategy !

287
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,578
A gumtape death match
is too dangerous !

288
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:21,249
Don't do it, Takumi !

289
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,859
I won't lose,
no matter what.

290
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,403
My pride says "You gotta be wild and tough."
