30
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,497
That's our law.

31
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:54,543
I made it.

32
00:01:55,462 --> 00:02:00,931
FR Killing Death Match !

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,160
That sonuvabitch hit
me on purpose !

34
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:16,498
I won't let
you get away !

35
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,925
Akina's potato is
keeping up with me ?

36
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,342
That little...

37
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,231
Don't screw
around with me.

38
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:22,005
His turn-in is
unbelievably fast.

39
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,244
Brake lights...?

40
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:28,143
His brake lights are on
during high speed cornering !

41
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:37,112
Damn, I can't
keep up with him.

42
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,341
He's got
incredible technique.

43
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:45,220
The turn-in of that EG6 might
be faster than Takumi's.

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,139
Who the hell is he ?

45
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:14,744
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,193
And he really
pissed me off.

47
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:24,002
Braking while cornering ?

48
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,842
And at high speed ?

49
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,251
Yes.

50
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,561
I've never seen anything
like it before.

51
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:34,370
Really ?
It happens often.

52
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,209
I brake in
corners so often.

53
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:45,098
Oh shit,
I'm too fast.

54
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:47,027
I'm scared, tap, tap.

55
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:50,427
We aren't having such
a low level conversation.

56
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:55,046
That EG6 cleared the corner
at a very high speed.

57
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,425
EG6 ?

58
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,774
It's the Civic.
A Civic.

59
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,834
Then why don't you
simply say Civic ?

60
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:09,323
Although the Civic is FF,
it's popular among Road Racers.

61
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:14,092
It's got a 1.6 liter, non-turbo engine like the Eight-Six...

62
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:17,991
...but it's very powerful thanks to its VTEC engine.

63
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:23,780
Civics and Levin/Truenos have
been rivals for a long time.

64
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,309
You can't neglect the Civic because you're driving an Eight-Six.

65
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,678
I can't yield to the Civic
because I drive the Levin !

66
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:42,086
Anyway, I can't believe how he braked after a high speed entry into a corner.

67
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:46,635
He's using a left
foot braking technique.

68
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,985
Left foot braking ?

69
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:53,294
You don't use that technique
with FR cars very often.

70
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:58,203
But you can use your left foot for braking for sensitive control at the limit.

71
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:04,651
FF cars like the EG6 experience understeering when you step on the gas pedal.

72
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:08,431
They use left foot braking while depressing the gas pedal...

73
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,080
...to lessen the rear load to stay on the ideal path.

74
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,430
It's an advanced technique.

75
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,589
If he used that, he must be
a really good FF driver.

76
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,798
He must be very fast.

77
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,637
He's fast,
but that sonuva...

78
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:31,776
I managed to avoid an accident because
I practiced spinning using the parking brake.

79
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:35,575
My S13 could've been
``hospitalized'' again.

80
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:39,074
He won't get away the
next time I see that EG6.

81
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,012
I'm home.

82
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,622
Hey.

83
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,541
Oh, you had a phone
call a while ago.

84
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,341
From who ?

85
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,411
I don't know.
It was a girl.

86
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,060
She was cute.
She said she'd call back.

87
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,049
How do you know if she's cute or not by talking on the phone ?

88
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,758
Being a man for a long time,
my instincts can tell.

89
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:11,798
Experience counts in
both women and cars.

90
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,697
Well, good luck.

91
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:14,597
Shut up.

92
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:18,446
I'd better go
to the meeting.

93
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:42,551
Hello, this is
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

94
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,831
Hello, Takumi...?

95
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,911
Mogi...?

96
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,700
Sorry.
Were you sleeping ?

97
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,410
It's about our plans...

98
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:08,366
Hey, this had better
not be a joke, Takumi.

99
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:13,415
If it turns out to be,
it'll end our friendship !

100
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:17,394
So she's coming
with another girl.

101
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,054
It'll be alright.

102
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:22,513
Mogi definitely said
she'd bring her friend.

103
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,523
I wonder if
she'll be cute ?

104
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:30,052
Nice body or maybe
incredibly beautiful ?!

105
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,182
Well, well ?!

106
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:35,031
I don't know.
She's Mogi's junior high friend.

107
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,890
Actually, I'm not so
picky about her looks.

108
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,699
If I keep my hopes too high,
I might be disappointed.

109
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:45,949
So you kept your
promise, Takumi !

110
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:49,348
I'm so happy to have
a good friend like you !

111
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,917
You're overreacting.

112
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,047
Just watch.

113
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:55,487
With a girl by my side,
I'll be the fastest on Akina !

114
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,426
How dare you !

115
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:01,845
Shit !

116
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,235
My Levin, my...!

117
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,374
They should be
here by now.

118
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,563
Takumi, did you wait long ?

119
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:14,043
Mogi, don't surprise
me like that.

120
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:17,182
I'll introduce you.
This is friend Saori.

121
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,822
This is Takumi
and Itsuki.

122
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,491
Nice to meet you.

123
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,410
Hi.

124
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,819
Cute babe.

125
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,538
So you're
a Road Racer ?

126
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,037
Yeah.

127
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:44,037
I'm on the team called
the Akina Speedstars...

128
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:47,906
...and I'm number
three or four.

129
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:52,515
Well, Akina's Levin is
well known in Gunma.

130
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:53,675
How cool.

131
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,534
What's a Road Racer ?

132
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:57,034
Oh, come on.

133
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,034
Don't you know, Natsuki ?

134
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:00,243
Road Racers are...

135
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,183
Way to go, Saori.
She's better than I hoped for.

136
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,382
Hey, Itsuki, watch out !

137
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,230
Should I drive ?

138
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,680
No, it's okay.

139
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,419
Sorry about that.
It's a bad Road Racer habit.

140
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,376
How do you feel ?

141
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,606
I'm fine now.

142
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,325
His driving is so rough.

143
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,784
Hey, Takumi and Natsuki !

144
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,483
This is great !

145
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,653
Why don't you
guys take a ride ?

146
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,642
They're getting
along well.

147
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:31,085
You know, I could
take you guys home.

148
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:32,415
Oh, it's okay.

149
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:35,734
We haven't seen each other for a while, so we want to talk more.

150
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:38,763
Itsuki, thank you.
It was fun.

151
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,363
See you again.

152
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:44,662
See ya.

153
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,072
S...Saori...

154
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:51,331
Saori, see you again !

155
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,558
Great, great, great !

156
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:07,947
She's the best !

157
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:13,856
I'm talking about Saori.
I feel so alive !

158
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,196
Saori !

159
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,515
Hey, drive carefully.

160
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,654
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

161
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,814
Thank you so much, Takumi.

162
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:31,352
She said ``again.''
I'll ask her to go driving.

163
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:32,702
Hey, look ahead.

164
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,119
Sorry, sorry.

165
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:58,537
Thank you very much !

166
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,996
Alright, is there
anything else to do ?

167
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:05,905
Work, work...

168
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:09,825
Itsuki's so excited.
I wonder if he found a girl...

169
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:10,704
I don't know.

170
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:14,344
If so, I won't forgive him
for getting ahead of me !

171
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,693
By the way, Takumi...

172
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:20,462
...do you feel like
driving my S13 ?

173
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:25,521
It's refreshing to drive a
different car once in a while.

174
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,591
No, thanks.
I'll pass.

175
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,970
Besides, it's your precious...

176
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,990
I'm begging you, Takumi.

177
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,659
I want to learn
from your driving.

178
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,029
Please !

179
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:56,335
Are you serious about
racing Akina's Eight-Six ?

180
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:58,625
You'll see.

181
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:03,684
Well, let's go.

182
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,581
C'mon, Akina's Eight-Six.

183
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,380
I'm looking forward
to seeing you.

184
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,988
Are you sure about this ?

185
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:30,188
I'm begging you, Takumi.

186
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:32,578
Just drive normally
and I'll be satisfied.

187
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:34,977
It'll be very helpful.

188
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,027
Come on,
just this once.

189
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,297
I don't know...

190
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:43,865
I haven't driven other cars,
so I don't think I can drive it fast.

191
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,285
Iketani's only
asking this much.

192
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,635
Why don't you drive ?

193
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,974
That's right, Takumi !

194
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:50,814
Give him a
little respect !

195
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:53,573
Alright then,
just this once.

196
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,353
Don't expect
too much, okay ?

197
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,473
Oh, you will ?

198
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:58,622
Yahoo !

199
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,971
Lucky you, Iketani.

200
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,831
Don't pass out, okay ?

201
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:11,320
Don't worry, don't worry.
This is the second time.

202
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,109
Push it hard, Takumi.

203
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,319
Okay, we're going.

204
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:15,969
Right.

205
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,636
What should I do ?

206
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,726
Well, how about
braking drift ?

207
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:32,705
Okay.

208
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:38,964
Hey.

209
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,924
You're gonna do
it right away ?

210
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:47,102
Aren't we going too fast ?

211
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,515
I wonder if Iketani
will be alright.

212
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:25,415
Once again...

213
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:31,034
I hear the echoes of a death cry in the Akina mountains !

214
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,553
The scary downhill...

215
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:36,602
....where Iketani,
in the third corner...

216
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,712
...p...p...p...passes out !

217
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:42,951
Will it happen again ?

218
00:16:57,998 --> 00:16:58,998
Incredible.

219
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:01,737
He's drifting a car he's
driving for the first time.

220
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:05,566
My S13 is
actually fast.

221
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:09,296
It's different
from my car...

222
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:12,215
...but I've got the hang of
how to drive this car.

223
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:15,744
B...but you only cleared
the third corner...?

224
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,884
Here comes the drift.

225
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,494
Drift...?

226
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,573
Then what was that in
the last three corners ?

227
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:55,146
I think I turned the
corner as I imagined.

228
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:58,536
Incredible...
He's so incredible.

229
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,085
I don't know
what's going on.

230
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:20,631
They're back.

231
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,399
Hey, you're
still conscious.

232
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,039
You've improved a bit.

233
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,978
So, Iketani, did you get
any hints for braking drift ?

234
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:39,827
Not a one.

235
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,977
I don't know
what happened.

236
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,377
Say what ?

237
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,686
What was the point of asking
Takumi for the favor then ?

238
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:47,576
Even if you
say so, Kenji...

239
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:51,575
...Takumi performs incredible
techniques so easily.

240
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:57,574
I ``learned'' that his level is totally different, and I can't learn from him yet.

241
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,173
That's a big
improvement.

242
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,570
An EG6 !

243
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,570
I'm sure it's the
one from last night.

244
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:54,382
Sonuva...

245
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:56,961
Hey, you're the one !

246
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,941
You hit my car from
behind, didn't you ?!

247
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,530
Who are you ?

248
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,530
Don't play innocent !

249
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,769
You remember this
two-tone S13, don't you ?

250
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:09,209
Oh, that one.

251
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,819
Don't give me
that crap !

252
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,458
Apologize !

253
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,258
You could've caused
a big accident !

254
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:18,407
Gimme a break.
It was your fault.

255
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:19,157
Say what ?

256
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:22,956
You were so slow I couldn't
predict your actions.

257
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,495
I didn't expect you to
enter the corner so slowly.

258
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,225
I couldn't brake in time,
and I touched your tail.

259
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:31,484
How dare you !

260
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:33,734
Stop, Iketani !

261
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,784
What an asshole.

262
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:39,043
Iketani's pride
is torn to pieces.

263
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:43,962
If you want me to apologize,
we'll race by our rules...

264
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:47,461
...and if you win, I'll
kneel down to the ground.

265
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:50,670
By your rules ?
What do you mean ?

266
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,900
It's not so difficult.

267
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,749
We call it a
gumtape death match.

268
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:58,849
Gumtape death match ?

269
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,318
Just bind your right hand to the steering wheel with gumtape.

270
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:05,897
That's the only rule.

271
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,747
We race under
those conditions.

272
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:12,086
Bind the right hand to the
steering wheel with gumtape ?

273
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:14,696
The left hand is free
for shifting, right ?

274
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:16,495
The right hand to
the steering wheel...

275
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,864
You can't pass the steering wheel from one hand to another !

276
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,993
You can't steer !

277
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:29,203
It's too risky !

278
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:31,742
I don't want
to race you.

279
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:32,892
Oh, yeah.

280
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:37,541
I heard that there's a fast Eight-Six downhill driver in the Speedstars.

281
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:42,240
I don't know who the brat is,
so why don't you send him out ?

282
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:59,037
Tell the Eight-Six brat that I'll be waiting here at 10:00pm next Saturday.

283
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:02,356
We'll settle everything with
a gumtape death match.

284
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:08,355
Catch ya later.

285
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:50,596
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."
