You feel like someone's careless act could end the world.

00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:05,474

...I can be my true self.

16
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:03,872
Kenji, I'm so
happy to be here.

17
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,551
Itsuki...

18
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:08,349
...it's wonderful
and gorgeous.

19
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,129
Takumi !

20
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:14,586
Come over here, and
let's go swimming together.

21
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:17,244
Well, I...

22
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:19,953
Okay, we're coming !

23
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:24,191
What's wrong ?
Hurry !

24
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,659
We're coming !

25
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,198
I'm so happy to
be here, Itsuki !

26
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:30,328
Senpai...

27
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:36,084
The End of Summer

28
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:41,401
You're coming,
right, Iketani ?!

29
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,140
What's wrong ?
Isn't this fun ?

30
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,138
S...sure it is.

31
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,056
Hey, Takumi, let's
go try the Slider.

32
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:54,924
I...I'll just stay and relax...

33
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,522
Well, he's always out of it.

34
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,692
If you don't mind
us going too...

35
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,920
Okay, let's all
go together.

36
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:04,939
Together, together !

37
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:07,077
Alright, let's go.

38
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,346
Okay, Takumi, let's go !

39
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:12,534
Well, I don't
like the Slider...

40
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:16,082
How can someone who can do such a super drift say that ?

41
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:22,759
Sayuki's so forceful,
and she's always like that.

42
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:26,536
I guess it's okay.

43
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:30,274
Is it okay for everyone
to take the day off ?

44
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,053
We begged to take
a paid vacation day.

45
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,401
The manager didn't
look too happy though.

46
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,856
She's so bright.

47
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:47,395
My heart is
almost bursting.

48
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:51,393
At least I've gotten to see
her in a bathing suit...

49
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:55,401
...so this'll be the greatest memory of my 21st summer of life.

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,590
I'll never forget it.

51
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:05,925
After all, Mako
is beyond my reach.

52
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,614
Iketani...

53
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:11,632
Thank you for
many things.

54
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:15,030
I need to thank
you for a lot.

55
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,328
I learned a lot
from that race.

56
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:21,447
Mako...

57
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:26,594
I caused you a lot of trouble, but I won't quit racing.

58
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,922
Really ?
That's great.

59
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:31,021
I didn't want
you to quit.

60
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:38,127
After all, I got conceited because they put the label of Usui's fastest on us.

61
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:44,114
No, you can't recover !
Just spin to stop !

62
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:03,693
I realized that I needed to learn a lot more about controlling a car.

63
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:09,800
If I quit racing now,
I'd leave something unfinished.

64
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,998
I'm glad
to hear that.

65
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:16,137
So something good came
out of what I did.

66
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,603
Iketani...

67
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:27,220
Do you remember the promise we made by the lake ?

68
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:35,746
You might have misunderstood because of the way I put it...

69
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,594
...but I wasn't trying
to make a deal.

70
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:45,551
I want you to
be my first man.

71
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:56,624
I'll be waiting for you in front of the signboard where we first met around 8:00 pm.

72
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,618
Slow down.

73
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,266
So cute !

74
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:15,494
I feel her breasts
on my back.

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,358
I...I feel something
on my back...

76
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,307
So pathetic.

77
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:48,057
Mako, get the ball !

78
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,475
Please !

79
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,666
Takahashi Ryosuke !

80
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,764
Ready, Sayuki ?

81
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,184
Here.

82
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:14,322
Where're you throwing it ?

83
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:15,571
Sorry, sorry.

84
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:21,888
I missed.

85
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:28,674
Why does she have a picture of Takahashi Ryosuke ?

86
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:33,981
Something wrong ?

87
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,270
No.

88
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:41,977
Umm...

89
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,665
Can I ask
you something ?

90
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,024
Sure.

91
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:51,362
You said you've
never had a boyfriend.

92
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:53,920
Right.

93
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,909
Even if you haven't...

94
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,907
...you've had a crush
or something, right ?

95
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,656
Y...yeah...

96
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:05,354
I wonder why you can't
go out with that guy.

97
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:10,121
Most guys would be attracted
to you because of your looks.

98
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:13,819
Impossible.
That'll never happen.

99
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,587
What kind of
man is he ?

100
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:20,776
He's a Road Racer.

101
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:28,661
It was when I was still in high school, so it was about three years ago...

102
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,636
Some senior schoolmates took me to watch a race.

103
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:40,885
I didn't know anything
at that time...

104
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,983
...but the way one car
went by shocked me.

105
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:50,590
His driving looked clearly different from the others, even to my amateur eyes.

106
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:57,225
I was shocked by this unknown world, and I was fascinated by the world of Road Racers.

107
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:13,047
I got my license right after that,
and then I worked hard to buy a car.

108
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:21,552
I practiced so hard...

109
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:25,780
...so that I would be
able to get close to him.

110
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,498
My motivation sounds silly.

111
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,304
I've gone to see his
driving quite often.

112
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,058
But I've never
talked to him.

113
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:53,005
So, I don't know if
I can call it love.

114
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:58,462
I don't know whether
I liked him or his driving.

115
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:01,180
But you liked him.

116
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Yes...

117
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,988
...I liked him so much.{Hiro:  Past tense, past tense, Iketani.}

118
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:11,835
What is this pain ?

119
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,693
Damn, I shouldn't
have asked.

120
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:18,590
She seems
so far away.

121
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:32,284
So her crush was on the
superstar of the Gunma area...

122
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,172
...Takahashi Ryosuke.

123
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:41,868
Now I know why
she likes FCs.

124
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:47,666
I can't.

125
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,074
I'm no match for him.

126
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:26,594
Finally, my brother has decided to race against Akina's Eight-Six.

127
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:32,930
Are you coming
with me, Keisuke ?

128
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,737
I'll show you my hypothesis
for the fastest driving.

129
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,167
Brother...

130
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:50,091
I enjoyed it so much !

131
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:53,779
I never knew going to the pool with girls was this fun !

132
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,779
Right, Takumi ?

133
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:59,326
But you were with Kenji
almost all the time.

134
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,712
Mako and Sayuki are
great, aren't they ?

135
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:08,421
Your recovery is quick.

136
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:12,239
You used to say that Road Racers don't need girls.

137
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,708
They're different.

138
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,445
Itsuki !

139
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:26,191
I can still see those
two in their bikinis !

140
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:27,940
It was awesome !

141
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,438
Sayuki's bouncy boobs are amazing,
but it's Mako after all...

142
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:35,616
She's got a knockout bod,
don't you think, Iketani ?

143
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,004
Yeah, true.

144
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:42,752
Something's wrong
with your reaction.

145
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,690
You look blue.

146
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,500
Did you fight
with Mako ?

147
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:52,037
No, I didn't.
I'm just tired.

148
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:01,062
Oh, what's the matter
at this time of night ?

149
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:03,941
Sorry about today.
I asked too much of you.

150
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:06,389
Oh, it's okay.

151
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,577
You're young, so you
need to have some fun.

152
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:15,084
I'd be worried if you were only into cars and didn't have a girlfriend.

153
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:17,843
Good luck, okay ?

154
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:21,501
Mako is your angel, right ?

155
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,130
Is it going well ?

156
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:29,016
I guess not.

157
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,684
She's beyond my
reach after all.

158
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:36,523
Don't be so discouraged.

159
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,511
Listen, Iketani,
girls are...

160
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:43,058
It's okay, Manager.
I've already given up.

161
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:47,207
I'm no match for
Takahashi Ryosuke.

162
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:49,785
What do you mean ?

163
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,559
What's happened ?~~I'm barely
keeping up with him.

164
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,905
His FC hasn't
been changed, so why ?

165
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:28,804
My hypothesis for the fastest driving is refined every time I get new data.

166
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,811
Wait for me,
Eight-Six of Akina.

167
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:36,939
As soon as I've completed it, I'll put your name on the list of losers.

168
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,672
I arrived before he did.

169
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:14,179
My chest feels tight.
My heart is pounding.

170
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,557
If I'm like this now, I don't know what I'll do when Iketani shows up.

171
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:20,715
What did you say ?

172
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,754
Are you stupid
or what, Iketani ?

173
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,582
You don't know
anything about girls.

174
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:26,262
Eh ?

175
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:27,172
Don't give me ``Eh !''

176
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,311
Think !

177
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:31,729
If she was actually going out with Takahashi Ryosuke, you'd be out of luck...

178
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:35,647
...but young girls have those kinds of feelings, you know ?

179
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:39,934
It's no different than
dreaming about TV stars.

180
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,623
Cool down, and think.

181
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:47,651
Because she chose you
over Takahashi Ryosuke...

182
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:50,239
...she took courage and
made up her mind.

183
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:54,586
Because she believes in you,
she told you how she feels.

184
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,446
Don't you get it ?

185
00:15:56,446 --> 00:16:00,603
Don't let your inferiority
complex hold you back !

186
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:05,771
To love someone means to
accept everything about her !

187
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:08,990
That's what loving and caring
is all about, isn't it ?

188
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:34,475
What ?!
Eight o'clock ?!

189
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:37,414
Idiot, you're thirty
minutes late already !

190
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,372
It's impossible.

191
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:43,620
It'll take at least one hour to get to Yokokawa no matter how fast I drive.

192
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,019
I don't think
she'll be waiting.

193
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,507
Shut up and go !

194
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,066
You won't know
unless you go !

195
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,964
If you don't go,
I'll fire you !

196
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,206
Drive like hell.

197
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:13,833
If you're a Road Racer, this is the time to drive like hell.

198
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:20,080
But having said that, I don't
think he can make it.

199
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,038
Well, I guess that's
part of being young.

200
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:39,739
The manager is right.
How could I be so stupid ?

201
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:50,244
I'll never have another chance to meet someone like Mako.

202
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:54,172
Why couldn't
I be honest ?

203
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,659
I'm Sato Mako.~~Call me.

204
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:03,027
I'll give you
my virginity.

205
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:08,834
I'll be waiting for you in front of the signboard where we first met around 8:00 pm.

206
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:14,281
Mako is always
serious, but I...I...

207
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:17,569
I'm so stupid !

208
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,847
My feet hurt.

209
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,935
I hate sandals.

210
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,767
Mako, I'm not expecting to go to a hotel or anything.

211
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,446
Well, actually...

212
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:23,163
No. I just want
to see her face.

213
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:29,279
Please, God, give me
one more chance.

214
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,458
Don't take my angel
away from my world.

215
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:38,455
Traffic jam ?

216
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:41,873
An accident in a
place like this ?

217
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:52,907
No, God, this
is so cruel !

218
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,882
Sorry, Mako.

219
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:18,852
I got no impression.

220
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:23,300
This town's made by imitation.

221
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:25,149
Wanting your sensation.{MAKO I'll never wear sandals again.}

222
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,337
I'll never wear sandals again.

223
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:31,486
In this silly simulation...

224
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,654
I wanna rage my dream.

225
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,038
I got no impression grey no kanjo

Rage your dream to break through the darkness.

232
