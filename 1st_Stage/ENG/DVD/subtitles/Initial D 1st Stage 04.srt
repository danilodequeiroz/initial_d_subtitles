The Battle Begins!
How's the
booster pressure ?

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,490
It's okay.

35
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,750
Don't forget to check
the tire pressure.

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,880
Okay.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,850
We'll win today's race.
It's a piece of cake.

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,610
Shut up and
keep on working.

39
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,500
Geez...

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,330
Hey, hand me
that cross wrench.

41
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,170
What're they doing ?

42
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,750
Changing the
tires of the FD.

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,320
They seem to have
a few sets in the van.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,820
Changing the tires according
to the situation ?

45
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,350
They're serious.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Dammit.

47
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,160
It's ready anytime, Keisuke.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,610
Arigato.

49
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,150
Hey, isn't
it 10:00 yet ?

50
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,010
It's still 9:40.

51
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,550
Shit.

52
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,050
Brother, that Eight-Six
hasn't showed up yet.

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,850
I'm getting pissed.

54
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,260
I was sure it
would represent Akina.

55
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,740
My prediction was wrong.
It's such a turn off.

56
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,150
Unless I humiliate them by winning the time attack by a big margin...

57
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,850
...I can't ease my anger.

58
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,550
Iketani, it's almost time.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, I know.

60
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,460
Who's that ?

61
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,830
Senpai !

62
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,420
Iketani !

63
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,810
Itsuki...

64
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,120
W...what about
the time attack ?

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
It's about to start.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,580
Great, I made
it in time.

67
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,100
Who's gonna run
for the Speedstars ?

68
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,340
Kenji, you'd better
prepare yourself.

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,500
You're representing the team ?

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,480
Good luck,
I'm with you !

71
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,320
This is the starting point.
Are you ready ?

72
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,650
This is the finish.
Everyone's in position.

73
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,350
We can begin any time.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

75
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,400
You heard that.
Shall we begin ?

76
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,140
So he didn't
come after all.

77
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,300
I'm counting on you, Kenji.

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Okay...

79
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,650
Gimme a break.
How can you be my opponent ?

80
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,760
Kenji, you don't look good.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,050
You're sweating a lot.
It's painful looking at you.

82
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,990
Even if you say so...

83
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,990
Guts !~~Put your
guts into it !

84
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,370
Alright, let's begin
the countdown.

85
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,070
Ten seconds...

86
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,330
Hold a second !
This is the finish line !

87
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,050
A car just passed by.

88
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,500
It could interfere.

89
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Should we wait until
it reaches the peak ?

90
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,960
This is a public street.  There might as well be oncoming traffic.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
Don't worry,
let's begin !

92
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,580
Okay.

93
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,050
Wait.~~Can you ask him what kind of car it was ?

94
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,100
Can you tell what
kind of car it was ?

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,480
Let me see...
It's got retractable lights.

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,350
It's probably an
Eight-Six Trueno.

97
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,350
Give it to me.

98
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,140
What color was
that Eight-Six ?

99
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,500
Why're you asking
me such things ?

100
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,150
White and black.

101
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,650
A panda Trueno.

102
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,770
He's here.

103
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,200
Here comes my target.

104
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,590
What do I do ?
Continue counting down ?

105
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,590
Stop counting down, and wait until the Eight-Six arrives.

106
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,110
The One-Eighty beside me
isn't my true opponent.

107
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,750
Right ?

108
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,500
Yeah, you're right.

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,320
Kenji, you can relax.

110
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,700
I'm saved.

111
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,890
Your eyes are watery.

112
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,270
Same as yours.

113
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,210
That old man has come to save the pride of Akina's Road Racers.

114
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,250
That's more than enough.

115
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,050
It doesn't matter
if we win or lose.

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,750
What the hell...?

117
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,560
I feel awkward.

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,670
People are standing
at every corner.

119
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,750
What're they doing ?

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,030
I've come to
a strange place.

121
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,390
What the heck...

122
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,840
...if I win, the tank will be full, and I can go to the beach without hesitation.

123
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,510
What's wrong, Takeshi ?

124
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,300
He's good.

125
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,870
The rear of the car, just leaving the corner, looked very steady.

126
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,430
Didn't you see ?

127
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,300
Even if you say so...

128
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,190
It looked like any
other ordinary Eight-Six.

129
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:22,000
Cars driven by those who can control their car like their hands and legs give off auras.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,080
A strong aura surrounds
Takahashi Ryosuke's driving.

131
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,950
It's still weak for
his brother, Keisuke.

132
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,320
But that Eight-Six
had a strong aura.

133
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,810
If he's representing Akina, we can't predict which one's gonna win.

134
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,050
Almost.
He's really here.

135
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,640
The fastest on
Akina's downhill.

136
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,770
A legendary
super technician.

137
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,970
We can show the Takahashi brothers the true potential of Akina.

138
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,760
Come on, Eight-Six.

139
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,220
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of driver he is.

140
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,490
I haven't felt such
anticipation in a long time.

141
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,760
He put things off
till the last minute.

142
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,300
But that trick
won't work on me.

143
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,990
Let me watch carefully.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,010
There it is !

145
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,680
Clear the street !
Guide it to the starting line !

146
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,310
What's that car for ?

147
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,840
They were waiting
for that car ?

148
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,850
But that's only
an Eight-Six.

149
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,450
Shit.~~Where did all
these people come from ?

150
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,350
Fujiwara Tofu Shop (Private Vehicle)

151
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,620
Excuse me...

152
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,390
Could that
Eight-Six be...?

153
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,850
Takumi...

154
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,850
T...that's...

155
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,360
So he's the one.

156
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,960
Takumi !

157
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,490
What's going on ?
What happened to your father ?

158
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,380
I came here because
Dad told me to.

159
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,680
Even if the car's here, it won't do anything unless your father is, too !

160
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,300
What should we do, Iketani ?

161
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,360
This wasn't supposed
to happen.

162
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,300
I shouldn't have
come after all.

163
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,100
That shitty old man
pisses me off.

164
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,660
Takumi, didn't your father say anything besides that ?

165
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,540
Dad only told me to go to the mountain peak and defeat the FD on Akina's downhill.

166
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,230
Your father told
you to drive ?

167
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,620
Yeah.

168
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,850
Can you defeat...

169
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,850
...Takahashi Keisuke ?

170
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,100
I won't know unless I try...

171
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,180
...but I defeated
him once.

172
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,600
Defeated him once...?

173
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,000
He'll give me a full
tank of gas if I win.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,700
So, if you let me try,
I'll win, no matter what.

175
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,620
Excuse me...

176
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,290
Umm, excuse me, excuse me.

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,580
Takumi, you
complete moron !

178
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,050
Ouch !

179
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,220
What's wrong with you ?

180
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,850
Takumi, how can you
be so stupid ?

181
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm so embarrassed
just looking at you !

182
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,130
Just move the car, and don't interfere with the time attack !

183
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,990
Get in the Eight-Six...

184
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,670
Hold on a sec, Itsuki.

185
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,500
Iketani, I'm very sorry !

186
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,100
He's so dumb, and he
doesn't know anything !

187
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,490
Please forgive him !

188
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,150
Takumi, your father isn't the only one delivering tofu, right ?

189
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,250
You do too, don't you ?

190
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,700
For the past five years,
I've been the only one.

191
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,850
For the past
five years ?

192
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,900
I finally get it, Takumi.

193
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,100
Okay, you'll drive the time attack on the downhill.

194
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,260
W...what're you
saying, Iketani ?

195
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,750
If an amateur like Takumi pushes too hard on Akina's downhill...

196
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,060
...he'll lose control
and die instantly !

197
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,850
Don't worry, just go
to the corner and watch.

198
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,150
I'm glad you're here, Takumi.

199
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,150
I'm counting on you.

200
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,150
Okay.

201
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

202
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,850
Dammit, I'm tired
of waiting.

203
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,850
He's so young.

204
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,350
Your name ?

205
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,840
Fujiwara Takumi.

206
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,500
I'll remember that.

207
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,450
I'm Takahashi Keisuke.

208
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,550
I won't make the
same mistake twice.

209
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,350
Is it alright ?

210
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,690
A race between an Eight-Six
and an FD is so unfair.

211
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,740
Its power is totally outclassed, and the FD is Japan's best cornering machine.

212
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,890
The Eight-Six is no match for it on the straightaways or corners.

213
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,100
All I can
do is believe.

214
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,230
I'm starting the
countdown.

215
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,790
Okay.

216
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,590
Okay.

217
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,850
Ten seconds to start !

218
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,680
Nine...

219
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,690
...eight...

220
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,270
...seven...

221
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,570
...six...

222
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,510
...five...

223
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,750
...four...

224
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,150
...three...

225
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,500
...two...

226
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
...one...

227
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Go !

228
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,520
Takahashi Keisuke's
FD is so fast !

229
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,590
350 horsepower isn't just for show, and his clutch meet was perfect.

230
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,200
This won't be a race.

231
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,990
The full acceleration of the Eight-Six almost looked like it wasn't moving.

232
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Takumi...

233
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:06,640
Judging from the start dash, that Eight-Six has 150 horsepower at most.

234
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,550
It's far from the
monster Keisuke says it is.

235
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,500
The reason why the
shift timing is quick...

236
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,150
...is because it has a close transmission, just like a rally car.

237
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,190
That suits Akina's tight
hairpin curves perfectly.

238
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,550
Even so, I can't find any factor for that Eight-Six to defeat Keisuke's FD.

239
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,850
The monster
isn't the car.

240
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,930
Could it be
the driver ?

241
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,670
I won't hold back.

242
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,550
It's not my style to go full out on the straightaway, but this is a time attack...

243
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,590
I won't see the Eight-Six
in my rear view mirror again.

244
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,430
What the hell...?

245
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,600
This is the
first corner !

246
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,780
That Eight-Six took
an incredible line !

247
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,320
It was 5 cm from
the guardrail !

248
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,210
I've never seen any
car that turns so fast !

249
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,400
What ?!

250
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,650
He's gaining on me.

251
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,930
His car is
getting closer.

252
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,600
No, it's not.

253
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,010
Something so
absurd can't happen.

254
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,500
A...are you serious ?

255
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,250
Takumi's father is
a great Road Racer ?

256
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,470
Yeah.

257
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,500
I've seen him
a few times.

258
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,550
He looked like an
ordinary tofu shop guy.

259
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,200
You can't judge a
person by appearances.

260
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,350
The manager told me that he's still the fastest on Akina's downhill.

261
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,500
Anyway, that old man sent Takumi here instead...

262
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,250
...so we have
to believe in him.

263
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,120
Yeah, it's much better
than me driving.

264
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,880
But no matter how fast his dad is, if it's Takumi...

265
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,580
Actually, it seems that Takumi has defeated Takahashi Keisuke once.

266
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,850
Takumi has defeated
Takahashi Keisuke ?!

267
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,710
You must be kidding !

268
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,150
I can't believe it.

269
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,910
That stupid Takumi
actually did ?

270
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,640
He didn't even know
what Eight-Six meant.

271
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,460
W...what's going on
with that Eight-Six ?!

272
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,220
It entered the corner at incredible speed while skidding the rear...

273
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,200
...and exited at
very high speed !

274
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,550
I don't know if it lost control !
It's just so exciting to watch !

275
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,440
He caught me !
What's going on ?

276
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,850
It's driving me crazy !

277
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,280
Shit !

278
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,950
Initial acceleration in second gear is almost the same, but he can stretch it longer.

279
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,510
The gap widens
on the straightaway.

280
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,810
This is from the straightaway in front of the skating rink !~~They've just passed us !

281
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,950
Keisuke is being pushed.

282
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,670
Akina's Eight-Six
is damned fast.

283
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,150
Holy shit !

284
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,450
I've never seen anyone charging on Keisuke's FD so close !

285
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm getting
goose bumps.

286
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,500
He's pulled away on the
long straightaway again...

287
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,830
...but the hairpins are coming up,
so he might be in trouble.

288
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,490
Did you hear, Ryosuke ?

289
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,500
We've made
a misjudgement.

290
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,420
We didn't expect Akina to
have such a skilled driver.

291
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,750
Incredible entry !

292
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,550
It was an entry
oriented kamikaze drive !

293
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,610
He lacks any fear
of the downhill !

294
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,950
I'm faster on the straightaway,
but he's still charging in.

295
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,220
He's better at
cornering work.

296
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,160
It's a Road Racer's worst disgrace to be tailed by an underpowered car.

297
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,780
I won't accept
that, no matter what !

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,460
That shitty old man won't call it a win unless I overtake that car.

299
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,220
It can't be helped, because the prize is a full tank of gas.

300
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,430
The attack point is the
five hairpin curves ahead.

301
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,620
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."

302
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,630
Sou tanin wo kaizai shinai
I don't let others meddle in.

303

Never stop. I don't want to stop...

304
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,420

You live in the present.

334
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,250
Finally, the race
has begun, Takumi !

335
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,710
Yeah.

336
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,490
Did you practice
for this battle ?

337
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,830
Not really.

338
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,960
It's just like
delivering tofu.

339
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,060
So your daily work is effective.

340
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,000
That's about right.

341
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,410
Do you have any secret
plan to overtake the FD ?

342
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,770
It's not really
a secret, but...

343
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,510
You have to win to use the Eight-Six with a full tank of gas to date Natsuki, don't you ?

344
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:55,550
Initial
Next Time:
End of the Dogfight!
Yeah.
Next time on Initial D...

345
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,550
...something's gonna happen
in the five hairpins.
Don't miss it !

346
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:07,550
