Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:00,196
Let's dive into the brand new trip.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,701
That's our law.

31
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:38,843
W...what the hell ?

32
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,966
I don't believe this.

33
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:00,796
Did I just see the ghost of a Road Racer who died here ?

34
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:05,327
His first counter-steer was a motion to get the right angle for the left curve.

35
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:13,428
It was the perfect drift of a driver who knows everything about Akina.

36
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,310
Keisuke, did you
see that Eight-Six ?

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,620
Yeah.

38
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,231
My pride is torn up.

39
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:34,092
My FD, with its mountain setup, was beaten by a 10 year old Eight-Six junker.

40
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:36,722
What the hell is
that Eight-Six ?

41
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:45,174
Declaration of Revenge~!~~Howling Turbo

42
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:45,874
Yes, Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

43
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:50,125
Hey, Takumi !~~Takumi !

44
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,875
How much longer are you gonna sleep ?
Get up !~~You've got a phone call !

45
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,666
It's Itsuki, isn't it ?

46
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,186
I don't know !
Hurry and pick up the phone !

47
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:05,647
Hello, it's me.

48
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,290
Takumi, over here !

49
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,551
Were you surprised ?

50
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:27,281
I was.

51
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,871
I thought it
was Itsuki.

52
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:34,982
I thought it was about time to restore our friendship.

53
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,283
Restore, you said ?

54
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:41,553
But we weren't in
a fight or anything.

55
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:46,394
You guys were talking about cars at school yesterday.

56
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,805
Can you drive, Takumi ?

57
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:51,685
Yeah, I just
got a license.

58
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:55,706
Then let's go driving
somewhere during summer break.

59
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:59,667
You drive and
I'll fix lunch.

60
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,287
Fine with me...

61
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,937
...but I only have
a dorky one for work.

62
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,478
I don't mind. It at least has a cassette deck, doesn't it ?

63
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:11,288
I don't care
what the car is.

64
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:13,299
I don't mind at all.

65
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,039
You don't ?

66
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,980
It'll be fun.
I'm getting excited.

67
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,601
Why don't we
drive a long way ?

68
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,561
That's right.
The ocean would be nice.

69
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:31,342
Let's swim together,
since it's summer.

70
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:51,245
No doubt.
It's the Eight-Six.

71
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:56,126
I bet the fastest on Akina
is the tofu shop's Eight-Six.

72
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:59,847
Is this the fastest
machine on the downhill ?

73
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:03,937
It looks like it's
an ordinary Eight-Six.

74
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,898
An early Apex model,
except for the fog lights.

75
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:14,619
A car like this can't be faster than the latest machines.

76
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:17,990
Something must be wrong
with me, searching for it.

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,320
Iketani.

78
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,081
Takumi.

79
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,161
What're you doing here ?

80
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,552
Hey, is this your house ?

81
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:31,302
Yeah.

82
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:37,263
What were you doing
in front of my house ?

83
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:42,174
I had something to do,
and I was just passing by.

84
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:47,745
Anyway, Takumi, you really don't know anything about cars.

85
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:54,306
You said you didn't know about
the Eight-Six yesterday...

86
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:57,307
...but the car at your
house is an Eight-Six.

87
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:02,487
Wait a minute.
It's not an Eight-Six.

88
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,138
It says Trueno
on the back.

89
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:09,069
You see, a Trueno
is an Eight-Six.

90
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:14,709
The Levins and Truenos with the chassis type AE86 are called Eight-Six.{Corolla SR5 in the U.S.}

91
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,660
Huh ?

92
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,040
An Eight-Six at
Takumi's house ?!

93
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,561
Are you serious, Iketani ?

94
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,431
Yeah, I'm serious.

95
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,311
Damn you, Takumi !

96
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,162
Why'd you keep
it a secret ?!

97
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:32,452
It couldn't be helped,
because I didn't know.

98
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:34,863
If it's a Trueno, why
don't you say Trueno ?

99
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,963
You said ``Eight-Six.''
Ordinary people don't call them that.

100
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,164
Why you...

101
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:44,615
By the way, I have
something to discuss.

102
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:48,115
Can you borrow the
Eight-Six next Saturday ?

103
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,275
Why ?

104
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,766
It's obvious.

105
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:55,366
We'll go watch the gathering
of the Speedstars and Redsuns.

106
00:06:56,467 --> 00:07:00,898
Since that incident yesterday,
I'm really into the Road Racer world.

107
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:06,478
Don't you want to see how the Takahashi brothers, the fastest on Akagi, drive ?

108
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:07,949
Not really...

109
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,219
Say what ?!

110
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,769
How can you say that ?!

111
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,220
Are you really
my friend ?!

112
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,060
I beg you to drive your
Eight-Six on Saturday.

113
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:23,121
Hey, guys,
what're you doing ?

114
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,401
You have a customer.

115
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,762
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,652
How can I help you ?

117
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:41,524
Installing brand new tires ?
You've really spoiled yourself.

118
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:45,805
I've got to cut my time by
installing high grip tires.

119
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,275
I'll also change
the brake pads.

120
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:50,866
Brakes are important
on the downhill.

121
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,536
Are you going
to run, Iketani ?

122
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:55,597
I'll run on
the downhill.

123
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:59,147
I'll tackle the downhill
of Akina like hell.

124
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:03,618
Don't push yourself too hard.
One mistake'll kill you on the downhill.

125
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:04,978
I know.

126
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:08,339
I know, but I
have to push it...

127
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,979
...for the locals' pride.

128
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:38,214
That Eight-Six didn't
show up today.

129
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:40,614
He isn't a Road Racer
from this area ?

130
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:44,765
No.~~He knew everything
about Mt. Akina.

131
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,855
I want to see it again,
and get revenge...

132
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,576
...or I won't be
able to calm down.

133
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,986
Come out,
ghost of Akina.

134
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,927
I don't care
about the Speedstars.

135
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:56,647
I'm here to face you.

136
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:05,699
That's just like the drift king,
Tsuchiya Keiichi !~~I can't sit still !

137
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,689
He must be controlling
it using only acceleration.

138
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:15,480
Takumi, I wish we could
perform a drift like that !

139
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,340
Yeah.

140
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,351
Look at that drift !
It's awesome !

141
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,091
Yeah.

142
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,882
Takumi...

143
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,152
Yeah.

144
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:30,093
You only say ``yeah, yeah !''
Do you really know what drift is ?!

145
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,753
Yeah, I know
what drift is.

146
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,964
Well then,
explain what it is.

147
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:38,494
In the curve...

148
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,895
Don't say curve,
it sounds so uncool.

149
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:43,095
Road Racers
call them corners.

150
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:46,535
Well, in the corner...

151
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:51,916
...you steer like this to let the front tires go outward so the car won't face the inside.

152
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,848
Gimme a break, Takumi !

153
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,918
If the front tires go outward,
you're experiencing understeering.

154
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,669
It shows your poor skill,
and it's totally uncool.

155
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,729
You let the rear go
outward when you drift.

156
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:12,130
You're strange.
You're incredible, Takumi.

157
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,490
Right.

158
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,581
You're the one who
doesn't know, Iketani.

159
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,911
When the car is drifting, it's supposed to be understeered.

160
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:27,152
It was the advanced answer of those who have mastered the four-wheel drift.

161
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:28,903
I'm impressed.

162
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,813
Here's a customer.
Let's get to work.

163
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:33,944
O...okay.

164
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:36,424
How can I help you ?

165
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,574
How can I help you ?

166
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:49,396
Takahashi Keisuke's FD ?

167
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,297
High octane,
fill it up.

168
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:55,227
Okay.

169
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,809
You're really devoted, sir.

170
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,360
Of course.

171
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,010
I thought I'd
seen that S13.

172
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,860
It's from the Speedstars.

173
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:24,033
Can I ask
you something ?

174
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:27,303
You should
know about it.

175
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,953
There's a ghost on
Mt. Akina, isn't there ?

176
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:33,794
A ghost of an
extremely fast Eight-Six.

177
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:39,805
Man, does he want
to fly or something ?

178
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:43,195
Please don't joke
around with me, sir.

179
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:46,716
I was joking about
the ghost part...

180
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,936
...but it's about a black
and white panda Trueno...

181
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:53,727
The exterior looks like a normal Eight-Six,
but it's an incredible monster inside.

182
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,458
A local guy should know about such an incredible car.

183
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:00,738
Well, it's okay.

184
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:06,229
If it's your secret weapon for Saturday,
I'm looking forward to it.

185
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,970
Tell the driver
of the Eight-Six...

186
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,040
...that I won't let the
same guy defeat me twice.

187
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,321
I lost because I wasn't familiar with the course and got careless.

188
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,492
Thank you.

189
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:24,822
Takahashi Keisuke lost...?

190
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,053
What does he mean ?

191
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,343
I didn't know any
Eight-Six could do that.

192
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,204
It can't be...

193
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:39,325
But the one at Takumi's house is also a panda Trueno.

194
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:42,795
Is what the manager
said true ?

195
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,826
The fastest on the downhill
is still that Eight-Six ?

196
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:27,593
Okay, that does
it for today.

197
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,115
It's more than usual.

198
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,665
Hey, just don't
spill it, okay ?

199
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,885
I know.

200
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,264
You look as sleepy
as usual, Takumi.

201
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:37,745
I'm sorry, but my face
is like this naturally.

202
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:42,086
Don't forget your Eight-Six
on next Saturday, okay ?

203
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:44,826
I know.~~You're so
persistent, Itsuki.

204
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:48,947
I have to be persistent or I can't clear my doubts about you.

205
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:53,718
I wish Saturday would
come early !~~I'm so excited !

206
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,048
Hey, since we hope
to be Road Racers...

207
00:14:57,048 --> 00:15:00,579
...we want to be called the fastest on Akina some day, right ?

208
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,649
I don't really
care either way.

209
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,950
Well, it's probably impossible,
even if you try...

210
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,221
...because you don't have a bit of talent, being scared in the rear seat of Iketani's car.

211
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,121
But I'm different.

212
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,402
Well, it was
a bit scary...

213
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:19,662
...but I could look at the sharp corners, clenching my teeth.

214
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:23,803
Iketani must have thought that there would be no hope for Takumi...

215
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:26,623
...but I have potential !

216
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,314
Takumi ?

217
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:30,704
Takumi !

218
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:32,204
Takumi !

219
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:35,045
Takumi, hey wait !

220
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:39,845
Even if you're jealous of
my talent, you're too cold.

221
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:40,856
I'm not...

222
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,406
Say what ?
Are you serious ?

223
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:46,757
And Rumiko told my boyfriend
about it.  He's so mad.

224
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:47,857
I saw it.

225
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:49,807
You like that ?

226
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,027
No.

227
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:55,378
It's a crime to make their skirts so short without thinking anything.

228
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:58,179
The school should regulate that.

229
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,009
Lucky.

230
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,460
Takumi, good morning.

231
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,981
M...Mogi.

232
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:14,091
Oh, I have something
to talk to you about.  Come with me.

233
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,362
Hurry.

234
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,912
W...what the hell ?!
What's going on ?!

235
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,413
What happened ?

236
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,064
Well...

237
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,864
...I have something...

238
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,104
...I want to tell you.

239
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,535
What is it ?

240
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:40,966
Well...I...

241
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:46,367
...bought a new bathing suit !
It's super cute !

242
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,257
Is that what you
wanted to tell me ?

243
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,867
Bingo.

244
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:54,368
Because I was so excited and I wanted to tell somebody about it.

245
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,298
Wanna see it ?

246
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,619
What color do
you think it is ?

247
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,469
You want to see
it soon, don't you ?

248
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:02,049
Well, I want to, but...

249
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:05,820
I'll let you see it as much as you want when we go to the ocean.

250
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,970
Until then...

251
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,571
...just...look...
forward...to...it.

252
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,411
What about this Sunday ?
Are you free ?

253
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,182
Yeah, I don't
have to work.

254
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,422
That'll do.
Promise me, okay ?

255
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,912
You can't break promises.

256
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:24,173
I don't like a person who breaks promises or smokes.

257
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,557
Damn, it's so difficult.

258
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:54,438
The dull corners now appear to be the scary and tight ones.

259
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:59,779
Those familiar corners
challenge me so differently.

260
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,083
It's no use.

261
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:27,324
Even if I push myself to the limit, I can't shorten the time.

262
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:30,985
I thought if I depressed the accelerator more, I could cut the time, but...

263
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,085
...it's not that easy.

264
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,636
Is this the best
my technique can do ?

265
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:40,066
There's no way
I can compete with them.

266
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,847
Hello !
Excuse me !

267
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,578
Hello !

268
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:53,528
Excuse me !

269
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:56,959
I can hear you.
Wait a moment.

270
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:00,990
How may I help you ?

271
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,030
Is he the Eight-Six driver who's the fastest on Akina ?

272
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,991
Is he the Road Racer who can beat Takahashi Keisuke ?

273
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:12,972
What do you want, sir ?

274
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,612
I'll have
a fried tofu.

275
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:17,693
Thanks.

276
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,723
What am I doing ?

277
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:24,494
Well, I'm Iketani...

278
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:27,994
...and I'm with a team
called the Akina Speedstars.

279
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:36,996
I heard a strange rumor that the fastest on Mt. Akina's downhill...

280
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:40,496
...is an old guy from a tofu shop, who drives an Eight-Six.

281
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:44,737
I don't know who said that,
but it's not me.

282
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:46,527
Please don't pretend
not to know !

283
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:48,098
Even if I searched
the entire city...

284
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:51,318
...I won't be able to find another tofu shop man who drives an Eight-Six.

285
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:53,259
Here.~~140 yen.

286
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,409
O...okay.

287
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,299
Okay, thanks.

288
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:01,450
Well, I'm in a
complicated situation.

289
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,650
Would you hear me out ?

290
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,551
Don't trouble me.
I'm working now.

291
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,112
You look bored !
No one else is here !

292
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:15,622
How rude, saying something directly that should've been held back.

293
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:19,013
I'm sorry,
but I'm desperate.

294
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:24,884
Actually, a team called the Akagi Redsuns challenged us to a time attack.

295
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:31,825
There are some highly skilled guys with the Redsuns, and we're no match for them.

296
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:36,366
I don't want to be
defeated as a local driver !

297
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,406
So, what do you
want me to do ?

298
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:44,007
Mr. Fujiwara, I want you to teach me how to tackle Akina.

299
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,948
That's impossible.

300
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,509
Just a little is fine.

301
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,189
I'll be satisfied, even if it shortens the time by a tenth of a second.

302
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:56,549
Please.

303
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,830
I know how you feel, but driving technique is not something you can obtain in a few days.

304
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,911
You have to think over and over how you can make the car run as you like...

305
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,391
...and keep on driving.

306
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:13,552
When I was actively driving,
I tackled Akina even in my dreams.

307
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:19,833
Technique isn't something to be taught, you must acquire it yourself.

308
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:28,015
I'm sorry that I can't
be of help to you.

309
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:31,295
Mr. Fujiwara, I'll
visit you again.

310
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:52,849
Think it over and over
and keep on driving...

311
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:56,019
I'm trying, but
I can't cut my time.

312
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,020
Why ?

313
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,671
Dammit. I can't figure it out, no matter how hard I think.

314
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:11,542
I can't dodge him !
Please, escape to the inside !

315
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,998
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."
