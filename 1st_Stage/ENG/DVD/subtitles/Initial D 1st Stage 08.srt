Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,300
Let's dive into the brand new trip.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,018

Trip to the world.

22
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,765
Yo! Here we go unknown world he to
Yo ! Here we go to an unknown world.

Umareta bakkari no tabibito

Narenai ashidori mo mata aikyou

Kimeru took dake bashitto
Get things done right only when needed.

26
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,182

...toki ni chuusyou toka mo nai wake ja nai kedo

Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,791
That's our law.

31
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:53,965
The galleries are packed.

32
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:57,543
It looks like there're more people here than during the match against the FD.

33
00:01:57,543 --> 00:02:00,542
That means the battle between Takumi and Nakazato of the Night Kids...

34
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,872
...has attracted
a lot of attention.

35
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:08,430
What should I do ?
I'm feeling even more depressed.

36
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,069
The mood won't allow us to simply say it was a mistake.

37
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,517
Takumi...

38
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:20,666
...please come !

39
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:29,393
Just Before the Time Attack!

40
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:33,913
Shit.

41
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:36,911
Where did that
stupid old man go ?

42
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,700
Do you think
you could win ?

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,198
I'd win. Whether it's a 32
or not makes no difference.

44
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:52,357
Do you think
I could win ?

45
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:58,025
I know that you didn't
accept the battle.

46
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,984
I'm telling you. You'd better stay away from the 32.

47
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:07,132
Takumi, the opponent is a 32, so even if you don't race, no one will think you ran away.

48
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:08,441
Run away ?!

49
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:21,668
The Night Kids are here !

50
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,616
It's Nakazato
with his 32.

51
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:37,143
It looks so powerful.

52
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:40,692
That black 32 deserves to
be the king of the street.

53
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,660
So they're
the Night Kids.

54
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,699
There're so
many of them.

55
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:57,306
S...Senpai, if we're going to apologize, the sooner the better !

56
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:59,066
Yeah, but...

57
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,886
We still have time.

58
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,224
Let's go
and ask him.

59
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:13,111
I don't think it's a good idea to drag him to a hopeless battle.

60
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:16,281
We won't know
unless we try.

61
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:20,990
It's impossible. You'll understand if you cool down and think.

62
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,878
The opponent
is a 32.

63
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:27,097
The power is totally different, and it's got 4WD ATTESA E-TS.

64
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,427
I thought so at
the beginning...

65
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:34,995
...but since I got here,
I started to believe.

66
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:39,304
The Eight-Six would have no
chance on the circuit...

67
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,862
...but this is
a mountain pass.

68
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:48,381
Since Takumi has been driving here for five years, we don't know what'll happen.

69
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:52,769
When Takumi drives, the
Eight-Six becomes extraordinary.

70
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:56,968
It turns into a super machine
with infinite potential.

71
00:04:56,968 --> 00:05:01,276
Because I rode next
to him, I can tell.

72
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:05,775
His driving is
beyond our imagination.

73
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:10,115
Oh, the incident of that frightening downhill with you screaming.

74
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,863
And you passed out
in the third corner.

75
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:18,682
His downhill driving
is that different.

76
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:22,760
And there's one more person
who feels the same way.

77
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,210
W...who's that ?

78
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:30,757
There's one more person who
has seen his driving up close.

79
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:32,367
That's...

80
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,777
Yes...

81
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,776
It's Takahashi Keisuke
of the Redsuns.

82
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,794
The Takahashi
brothers are here !

83
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:46,313
Now that the stars are on stage, I'm getting so excited !

84
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,041
Keisuke !

85
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,811
Ryosuke !

86
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,061
You're so cool !

87
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,620
They're good looking,
so they attract girls.

88
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,358
Damn, only skill should make
a Road Racer popular.

89
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,397
We can't defeat
them in any way.

90
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:09,895
And they're rich.

91
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,724
I knew they'd show up.

92
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,186
I'm looking forward
to the battle.

93
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:47,965
I'll prove who's the best
in the Gunma Prefecture.

94
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,833
It's not the Eight-Six
or the Takahashi brothers...

95
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,872
...it's me, Nakazato Takeshi
of the Night Kids.

96
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,142
Asshole...

97
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,140
The Eight-Six hasn't
shown up yet.

98
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,549
I'll have to go
and convince Takumi.

99
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:10,607
Get in.

100
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,076
What's wrong, Itsuki ?

101
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:20,174
I'll stay, Iketani.

102
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:23,473
I can't face Takumi.

103
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:26,423
I see.

104
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,631
Wait until the
last moment, okay ?

105
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:30,371
I'll bring Takumi,
no matter what.

106
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,258
He will...
Takumi will come.

107
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:41,748
Besides...

108
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,867
...I like this place.

109
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:49,265
I'm getting
used to this.

110
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,152
Oh, dear Ryosuke.

111
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,409
Why...

112
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,479
I'm frustrated to death.

113
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,538
I want to go to
Mt. Akina so much.

114
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:18,606
I don't know if I like
to drive that much or not.

115
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:25,795
But I've been driving alone for five years, whether it was snowing or raining.

116
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:29,803
I've driven Akina
more than anyone.

117
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:34,752
I want to test
how good I am.

118
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:41,259
I want to challenge the
GT-R with all my skill.

119
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,959
I've never felt
this way before.

120
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,087
I'm not giving up, even
though I don't have a car.

121
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:52,616
Instead, my desire to
drive is getting stronger.

122
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,594
Dammit, Dad.

123
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:01,223
Where're you
wandering around ?

124
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:11,140
Takumi.

125
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,620
Iketani...

126
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:20,137
Say what ?

127
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:24,787
Your dad left with the car,
and hasn't come back ?

128
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:25,575
Yeah.

129
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,595
Don't you know
where he is ?

130
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:35,332
I thought he'd be at a bar, so I called all the places I could think of.

131
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,392
And you couldn't
get a hold of him.

132
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:44,889
The Eight-Six isn't here and
we can't even persuade you !

133
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:48,159
This is unexpected.

134
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,128
Senpai, you came
to persuade me ?

135
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,326
Yeah.

136
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,756
The mountain
is in an uproar.

137
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:02,855
Nakazato of the Night Kids and the Takahashi brothers are entertaining the galleries.

138
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:06,463
But you're
today's main attraction.

139
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,672
Wait a minute.
Please, don't.

140
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:12,512
No matter what you say,
I can't do anything.

141
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,950
You won't change
your mind, will you.

142
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,770
I don't mean that.

143
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,539
Actually, I was
going to go.

144
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,259
What ?!

145
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,117
But without a car,
I can't do anything.

146
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,726
I've been so depressed,
sitting here alone.

147
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:32,846
How could this be...?!

148
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:34,764
It's so frustrating.

149
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:37,474
Without a car...
Without a car...

150
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:38,763
That's it.

151
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,993
Hey, Takumi, what about
borrowing Kenji's 180 ?

152
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,031
That's a good idea !

153
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:48,061
It's got the same FR layout, and it has a turbo, so it's more powerful !

154
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,540
If you drive it,
it'll run fast !

155
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,180
I don't think so.

156
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,958
Why not ?

157
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,368
I don't want to drive
someone else's car.

158
00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:00,957
It has to be a car
I'm familiar with.

159
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,295
That's true.

160
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:09,474
It's not a good thing among Road Racers to drive someone else's car.

161
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:14,992
I'll wait as long as I can.
That's all I can do.

162
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,299
It's 9:45.

163
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,798
I guess they
didn't make it.

164
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:32,996
He's late.

165
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:33,766
What time is it ?

166
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,556
Almost 10:00.

167
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,995
We aren't
gonna make it.

168
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,305
Where are you, Dad ?

169
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,643
Please, come home.

170
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:44,093
We don't have time.

171
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,909
He's back.

172
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:03,027
That rhythm of revving up twice when turning from the interstate...

173
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:04,967
...that sound...

174
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:08,086
Dad's coming home.

175
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,731
You can tell by just listening to the exhaust sound ?

176
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:27,670
Is that really your car ?

177
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,110
I can tell.
I'm positive.

178
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:36,157
The Takahashi
brothers are here.

179
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:40,367
Yeah, they can't
ignore this.

180
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:45,674
He told me that
I'd be defeated.

181
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:51,722
That Takahashi Ryosuke is known for logical thinking, but he doesn't seem that good.

182
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:57,031
I'll defeat the Eight-Six in front of him, and humiliate him.

183
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:59,501
Let's do it.

184
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:06,518
If you're faster than the Eight-Six, which defeated Takahashi Keisuke...

185
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:09,068
We're faster
than the Redsuns.

186
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:15,465
It's a good opportunity to let those galleries know one thing.

187
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:21,033
Drift driving can't
defeat grip driving.

188
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:25,292
It's your favorite phrase.

189
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,772
Of course.

190
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,310
Drift is just a performance to excite the galleries.

191
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,880
It's not a technique
to race with.

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,579
That sounds just
like you, Takeshi.

193
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:42,057
When I was driving the 13,
I learned drift, so I can tell.

194
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:47,006
When the master of drift uses a grip technique, he can drive even faster.

195
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:51,154
It was shocking when you
were defeated by that 32.

196
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:54,923
Sorry, I wasn't
supposed to say that.

197
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,501
I was changed
at that moment.

198
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:05,690
I switched to the 32, the monster that defeated me, and my skill improved.

199
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,468
Who can call a person a Road Racer if he doesn't pursue better driving ?

200
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:12,698
All everyone talks about is drift, drift, and thinks highly of those drivers.

201
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,967
I can't stand that.

202
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,967
Come on, Eight-Six.

203
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:22,155
Drifting with the FR layout
is old hat. I'll prove that.

204
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:27,434
As usual, he isn't showing
up until the last minute.

205
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,702
Do you think he'll
really show up ?

206
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,391
He said he wasn't
interested, didn't he ?

207
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,451
No, he'll be here.

208
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:38,639
I'm sure of it.

209
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,029
He'll definitely
be here.

210
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:52,116
Well, that's what this is all about, so let me use the car, Dad.

211
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:56,035
You'd better hurry, Takumi.
It's almost time.

212
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,973
Sorry, but I'm
borrowing Takumi.

213
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:02,023
When we return,
I'll buy ten fried tofu.

214
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,392
I'll buy ganmodoki, too.

215
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,590
W...wait.

216
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:18,717
Takumi's eyes
looked different.

217
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,277
What's going on ?

218
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:29,084
Oh well, he'll be able to race evenly with that setting.

219
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:38,361
The mountain pass is close. I wonder if you can keep up with him, Kenji.

220
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,361
Oh, come on, Iketani.

221
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:42,490
That's a 1.6 liter non-turbo.

222
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,270
I've got a
2.0 liter turbo.

223
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,928
I'm not sure about the downhill, but if he pulls away on the uphill, I'll lose face.

224
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:54,657
I'm one of the top
three of the Speedstars.

225
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:06,502
He's so fast.

226
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:09,512
Me too !

227
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,299
Exit the corner,
then full acceleration !

228
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,098
He's gone.

229
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:22,778
The Eight-Six has vanished.

230
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:39,463
Takumi was also looking away in the entrance ceremony picture.

231
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,000
Two more minutes
till 10:00 pm.

232
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,987
I guess they
didn't make it.

233
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:06,204
I'd better give
up and apologize.

234
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:16,431
No, Iketani told me to wait.
If I go off on my own again...

235
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,638
But it was my fault, and it has nothing to do with the Speedstars.

236
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:30,587
I'd better prepare for
one or two punches...

237
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,974
There are so
many of them !

238
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:43,824
I don't think I'll be forgiven
with only a punch or two !

239
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,851
No way.
I want to run away.

240
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:55,919
They won't forgive me easily
if the Eight-Six doesn't show up.

241
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:10,425
Even if I kneel to the ground, they won't forgive me. I might be killed.

242
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:16,263
Father, Mother, help me.
Please, God.

243
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:20,752
I've never slept with a girl,
and I don't wanna die !

244
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:23,510
There !
There he is !

245
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,270
No.
They found me.

246
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,619
I can't even run away.

247
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,619
I'll be killed.

248
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:52,531
What're you doing, Itsuki,
sitting in the middle of the road ?

249
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,161
T...T...T...

250
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,680
You're in my way.
I'm gonna run over you.

251
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,058
Takumi, you came !

252
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:07,257
Yeah.

253
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:10,467
Sorry I'm late, Itsuki.

254
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,365
Takumi...

255
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:17,644
Road Racers have to accept
challenges, don't they ?

256
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,914
Takumi...

257
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:25,182
Stop it !
Hey, Itsuki !

258
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,551
That's more like it.

259
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,368
This is Fujiwara
Tofu Shop.

260
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:39,548
Oh, it's you, Yuichi.

261
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,906
You're there ?

262
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,596
I don't know
what's going on.

263
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:48,665
He wanted to go to
the mountain himself.

264
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:51,423
Like father, like son.

265
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,573
Besides, Bunta, tonight's
opponent is a GT-R.

266
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,482
Honestly speaking, do you think he has a chance of winning ?

267
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:02,840
The Eight-Six finally showed up.
Keisuke, he came as you predicted.

268
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,130
Yeah.

269
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,519
Weren't you going to tell him the weakness of the 32 ?

270
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,587
I was going to,
but I decided not to.

271
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,876
After seeing his face,
I started hating him.

272
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:19,636
He's my enemy,
after all.

273
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,814
Besides...

274
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:26,933
...even if he doesn't know
its weakness, he won't lose.

275
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,313
Did you give
him any advice ?

276
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,581
Not really.

277
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:36,470
Even if it's the GT-R,
it has its weakness.

278
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,710
The weakness of
the 32 is...

279
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,478
...the weight
of the body.

280
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:45,197
Understeering due to the
super heavy front load.

281
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:49,995
Suspension tuning and driving technique can't change its fundamental characteristics.

282
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:55,274
After pushing hard on the downhill, the front tires and brakes will weaken.

283
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:58,004
Even if the
brakes are tuned...

284
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,312
...by the time he reaches the base of the mountain...

285
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:04,901
...he has to cope with understeering at the corners' entrances.

286
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:12,059
His chance of winning lies at the entrance of the corners in the second half.

287
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,168
The key point
of this battle...

288
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:20,046
...is whether the Eight-Six can keep up with the 32 until then or not.

289
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:24,136
I changed the suspension setting of the Eight-Six a little.

290
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:27,505
The suspension ?
How ?

291
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:34,322
Heavy understeering when
the gas pedal is open.

292
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:38,262
What ?!
Heavy understeering ?!

293
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:41,760
Drift is Takumi's style.
What's on your mind, Bunta ?

294
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,359
Will he be able to keep up with the GT-R with that setting ?

295
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,869
Don't you get it, Yuichi ?

296
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,557
If the driver is skilled...

297
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:53,057
...he can depress the accelerator harder when it comes to the FR layout.

298
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:57,706
He has to deliver tofu, so the setting is usually compromised a little bit.

299
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:04,203
He can open the throttle
longer with the current setting.

300
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,550
If the driver
is skilled...

301
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,898
...I'm sure he
can handle it.

302
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:50,559
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."

00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,327
Rikutsu dake no nogaki tachi
The puffery, full of logics...

326
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:04,387
Jama kusai kara shikato shiteikou
...is bothering, so let's ignore it.

327
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:06,325
Streaker satteiku street no mukou
The streaker disappears into the street.

328
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,725
Something they would know.

329
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:08,675
Rage your dream.

330
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:11,724
Tsuzuku hatenai michi wo
In the never-ending street...

331
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:15,722
Ai mo kako mo furimukazu
...without looking back at your love or your past...

332
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:19,722
Yukeru anata kagayaiteiru
...you keep on going, so you shine.

333
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:20,721
Rage your dream.

334
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,641
Ima wo ikiteiru
You live in the present.

335
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,008
Nakazato, how's your chance of winning against the Eight-Six ?

336
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:35,416
Psheesh.
It's so obvious.

337
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,716
So, the 32 will win.
But Takahashi Ryosuke...

338
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,165
He's hesitant because his brother was defeated.

339
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:46,003
I'll show them that I'm
the fastest in Gunma...

340
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:50,572
...and grip driving is superior.
He'll just be eating my dust.

341
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,502
What's that ``psheesh ?''

342
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:54,550
It's only action, action !

343
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,360
Next time on Initial D,
``The Battle to the Limit.''
