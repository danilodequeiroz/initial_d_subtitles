Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,352
Let's dive into the brand new trip.

Narenai ashidori mo mata aikyou
Unstable footsteps are fun to watch.

25

Kimeru took dake bashitto
Get things done right only when needed.

26
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:27,262

Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:34,878
That's our law.

31
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:40,684
Five seconds !

32
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,674
Four !

33
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:42,684
Three !

34
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:43,757
Two !

35
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:44,847
One !

36
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:45,668
Go !

37
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:09,238
I've been steering hard,
keeping the ABS on !

38
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:12,963
So the load to the front tires is greater than I expected !

39
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:16,125
It's getting tough !

40
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,260
The five hairpins
are ahead...

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,800
What ?

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,905
The place where you were overtaken will be the key point.

43
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:38,916
Dangerous Five Hairpins

44
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,592
The Eight-Six is
right on his tail !

45
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:12,345
I don't believe it !

46
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,397
Nakazato is fighting
so desperately !

47
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:15,447
What's going on ?!

48
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:42,412
Look !~~That's the braking
drift of the Eight-Six !

49
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,843
Awesome.

50
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:53,462
The FC...?

51
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,732
Takahashi Ryosuke.

52
00:03:56,483 --> 00:04:01,508
I watched Keisuke being overtaken by the Eight-Six in these five hairpins.

53
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:05,402
That Eight-Six used
the gutter to turn.

54
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,758
He blocked the inside.
He's trying not to let him squeeze in.

55
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,089
That Nakazato...

56
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,003
What're you going
to do, Eight-Six ?

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,223
What ?
From the outside ?!

58
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,570
Watch out !

59
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,483
It's gonna crash !

60
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,210
Don't screw around with me !
I won't let you pass from the outside !

61
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,039
Just like the 32.

62
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,511
Sharp acceleration at
the exit is great.

63
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,044
Besides, that Eight-Six...

64
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:07,156
He kept skidding in
such a narrow curve.

65
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,519
Three more corners...

66
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,391
...and this battle
will be settled.

67
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,255
He's going to overtake
from the outside again !

68
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,070
So frustrating !

69
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,972
It pisses me off when
he gets outside of me !

70
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,086
The 32 is
acting strange.

71
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:53,027
Nakazato has lost
his concentration.

72
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,088
Keep your eyes
on them, Keisuke.

73
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,441
The Eight-Six's
gonna overtake him.

74
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,693
Overtake him...?

75
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,446
But the inside
is blocked.

76
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,096
How ?

77
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,451
Takumi's trying
to overtake him ?

78
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,893
Really ?

79
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:12,063
Great.

80
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:14,057
Way to go, Takumi !

81
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:25,897
I'm humiliated in front of so many galleries, almost being overtaken from the outside !

82
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:28,118
Because I get too
close to the inside...

83
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:30,572
...the car misses the ideal line,
and the entry speed has to be slower !

84
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:35,074
That's right.~~I only have to make a space slightly narrower than a car !

85
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:38,077
That way, my entry
speed can be faster !

86
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,754
Good, he's not gonna
take the inside !

87
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:09,715
The Eight-Six disappeared !

88
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,919
It can't be...!

89
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,111
Dammit, it understeered
at a critical moment !

90
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:37,110
He tried to go outside, and then he changed the line while braking !

91
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,321
The Eight-Six is capable
of doing that ?

92
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,875
But don't think that
you're going to win !

93
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:47,710
If we accelerate side by side, I'll be able to pull ahead at full throttle in 2nd gear !

94
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,261
I'll show you the true
potential of the 32 !

95
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,677
I lost.

96
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,972
The 32 and
I have lost.

97
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:30,778
No, that's not right.
Only I lost.

98
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,518
The car didn't lose
to the Eight-Six.

99
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:42,488
An incredible Road
Racer like him exists.

100
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:53,127
It's shocking,
but I feel refreshed.

101
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:56,499
Although I lost,
I tried my best.

102
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,254
What a pain.

103
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,857
The bodywork will
cost 70,000 yen ($700).

104
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:09,873
I'll train myself and
challenge him again.

105
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,848
He did it !
Takumi won !

106
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,060
He did it !~~He did it !

107
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,953
He did it !

108
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:24,194
Takumi did...
Takumi did it !

109
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,668
N...no way.

110
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:30,580
The Eight-Six overtook the 32 in
the fourth corner of the five hairpins !

111
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,443
How could the Eight-Six
defeat the 32 ?

112
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,204
The Eight-Six did ?
Really ?

113
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:45,384
I don't believe it !

114
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:49,256
It's just like you said, Bunta.
Just like him.

115
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:58,956
It's fun to watch interesting
things, isn't it, Keisuke ?

116
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:03,519
Yeah, the attack of the
Eight-Six was incredible.

117
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,265
He pretended to go outside, but changed the line during full braking.

118
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,070
It's got wonderful ABS.

119
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,321
What are you saying ?

120
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,122
Don't be dumb, Keisuke.

121
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:22,876
How could an Eight-Six
be equipped with ABS ?

122
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:23,917
Because...

123
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,830
That was human ABS.

124
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,335
Those Road Racers who've gotten used to modern cars equipped with ABS...

125
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:37,650
...would never be able to master severe pedal control just before locking their tires.

126
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:45,727
ABS is computer controlled, so it can't surpass the right foot of a well-trained driver.

127
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:51,552
I'm finally excited
after such a long time.

128
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:56,196
That Eight-Six is definitely
worth defeating.

129
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:30,707
Why're you
standing there ?

130
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:33,039
No reason.

131
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:39,294
Hey, Dad...

132
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,634
...about this car...

133
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,543
What ?

134
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:53,308
It's alright.
It's nothing.

135
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:57,050
I'm going to bed.

136
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,611
I bought an Eight-Six !

137
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:34,584
I kept it secret, but
it was delivered today !

138
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:36,975
It's still clean !

139
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:41,000
So you begged your dad,
and made him a guarantor.

140
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:47,495
The shop was nice, and I got a good price for the condition of the car.

141
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:51,880
Looks really good.
It could be a find.

142
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,462
I'm surprised.

143
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:57,482
You really
bought one, Itsuki.

144
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,365
Of course, Takumi.

145
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:02,717
I can't let you get
too far ahead of me.

146
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:06,882
From now on, I'll try to be one of the two fastest Eight-Six downhill Road Racers.

147
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,126
Such a big talker.

148
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:15,221
I couldn't sleep last night
because I was so happy.

149
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,481
I know what you mean.

150
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:21,596
I couldn't sleep the night
before my S13 was delivered.

151
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:25,828
That's right.
It's really my car.

152
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:26,798
My car.

153
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,692
I feel like I'm
having a dream.

154
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:35,167
Normal wheels and 70 aspect ratio tires look pathetic but adequate.

155
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,378
Hey, start up
the engine, Itsuki.

156
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:39,652
Sure.
No problem.

157
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:53,242
It doesn't
sound so good.

158
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,204
I guess it's because
the muffler is normal.

159
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,629
Don't worry.
I'll change the muffler.

160
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:04,383
I want to make it sound
as good as Takumi's Trueno.

161
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:10,658
I have a bad feeling.
Pop the hood, Itsuki.

162
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:29,195
I thought so.

163
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,005
Manager.

164
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,729
You're mistaken, Itsuki.

165
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:35,710
Mistaken...?

166
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,434
This isn't
an Eight-Six.

167
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:40,134
It's an Eight-Five.

168
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,155
Eight-Five...

169
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:45,029
You mean an AE85 ?

170
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:56,009
Comparing the Eight-Six and Eight-Five,
the body is the same...

171
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:00,221
...but the performance differences are like chocolate and shit, a goddess and an old maid !

172
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:05,476
The Eight-Six has a double overhead cam engine, and the Eight-Five has a single one !

173
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:09,851
DOHC and SOHC are
totally different !

174
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,735
You bought a car
without knowing that ?!

175
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:14,135
How lame !

176
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,942
Sorry, sorry, Itsuki,
but it's so funny !

177
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,421
Wait, Itsuki !

178
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,607
You guys laughed too much.

179
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,261
Think how
Itsuki feels.

180
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,571
Sorry...

181
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,336
Itsuki !

182
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:54,711
Leave me alone !
Don't bother me !

183
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,063
Even if you say so...

184
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:08,983
It was my fault for looking for a car by myself to surprise everyone.

185
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:13,017
That explains why it was
so cheap for an Eight-Six.

186
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:16,089
I got so excited
without knowing it.

187
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,052
I'm so embarrassed
I could die.

188
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:22,534
You're laughing inside,
aren't you ?

189
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:23,547
No.

190
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:28,732
I'm envious of you.

191
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:29,652
Envious ?

192
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,424
Don't give
me that BS !

193
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,658
It's not BS.

194
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:39,710
You're still in high school
and you have your own car.

195
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,583
My own car ?

196
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,825
Yeah.~~What's wrong
with an Eight-Five ?

197
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:48,418
It's got an engine,
tires and it runs.

198
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:51,670
Even if it doesn't have power,
it can pick up speed on the downhill.

199
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,215
Why don't you practice hard
and learn some techniques ?

200
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,044
Cars are interesting.

201
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:06,905
You know,
you've changed.

202
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:08,215
Have I ?

203
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:12,409
Yeah, you were uninterested
in cars before.

204
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:18,094
Takumi, I feel like I could
like my Eight-Five.

205
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,626
I'm not that
good anyway.

206
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:21,999
Right.

207
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,881
Don't agree
so easily.

208
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:30,606
I'd better drive on
Mt. Akina tonight.

209
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,106
Takumi, come with me.

210
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:35,330
Sure.
With your Eight-Five.

211
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,861
Takumi...

212
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,715
I'll pick you
up around 10:00pm !

213
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:42,666
Promise me, okay ?

214
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,467
Okay.

215
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,050
Don't go to bed,
just wait for me !

216
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:54,997
Didn't see
the Eight-Six.

217
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,250
I wanted to see it.

218
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,112
It's hard to imagine that an Eight-Six defeated a 32.

219
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:21,201
Isn't that
an Eight-Six ?

220
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,282
Could it be...?

221
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:28,697
Man, it's so fun driving
the mountain pass !

222
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,498
It's slow on
the straightaways...

223
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:33,592
...but it runs well in the
corners, doesn't it, Takumi ?

224
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,552
Yeah, more or less.

225
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,012
What're you doing ?

226
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:49,777
Well, if I look at
it from a distance...

227
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:52,308
...my Levin looks cool.

228
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,233
Why're you so
cool, my Levin ?!

229
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,114
I'm glad I bought
this Levin !

230
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:03,338
How optimistic you are.

231
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,523
They're just brats.

232
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,164
They couldn't be.

233
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:14,878
The technician who defeated
the 32 couldn't be one of them.

234
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:16,150
Right.

235
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,094
How old are you ?
Do you have a license ?

236
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,695
If you don't,
you'll be in trouble.

237
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,808
I do.

238
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:27,700
I look young, but
I'm eighteen years old.

239
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,840
What's with them ?
They're so rude.

240
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:32,794
What's the point of
picking on a child ?

241
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:38,799
I don't like young Road Racer
wannabes driving Eight-Sixes.

242
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,801
You're a local,
aren't you ?

243
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,424
We came here to see
the famous Eight-Six.

244
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:44,824
Do you know about it ?

245
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:49,799
Don't you have a mouth ?
You know about it, don't you ?

246
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,881
Well...I know
about it...

247
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,936
But I don't think
it'll show up tonight.

248
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:59,346
That sucks.~~And after we
came all the way up here.

249
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:00,420
Let's go home.

250
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:07,525
If you're trying to be a Road Racer,
try not to be so pathetic.

251
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,847
What's wrong with
this Eight-Six ?

252
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:14,250
These normal wheels make
me sick just looking at them.

253
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:17,855
It's so lame.

254
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:19,506
At least change
the muffler.

255
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:21,757
It sounds so uncool.

256
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:26,011
Do you know anything
about an Eight-Six ?

257
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:30,866
Well, it's not an Eight-Six,
it's an Eight-Five.

258
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:34,568
So even if I changed the muffler,
it won't sound good.

259
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,881
I still want to
change it though.

260
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,372
Eight-Five ?

261
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,878
Even if you want
to change the muffler...

262
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:48,381
...you won't find one anywhere
that fits the Eight-Five !

263
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,143
None, anywhere.

264
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:51,533
My eyes are watering !

265
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,957
I've never seen anyone
driving an Eight-Five !

266
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,828
A brat deserves
an Eight-Five !

267
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,732
Let's go home.

268
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:02,813
I laughed so
hard I cried.

269
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,813
Try hard and don't let
a scooter tailgate you.

270
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,849
I'm pissed. I can't let
them get away with that.

271
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:34,923
Itsuki, let me use
your car for a while.

272
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:35,473
Takumi !

273
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:37,284
Get in the
car quickly.

274
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,538
What're you gonna do,
chase them ?

275
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:46,373
The suspension on the Eight-Five
is so weak, and the tires are normal !

276
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,794
I don't care.

277
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:49,935
Hey, Takumi, don't !

278
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,369
It doesn't have the limited
slip differential, and...

279
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,730
Who cares.
Put your seatbelt on.

280
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,655
It might be a little scary, but just trust me and bear with it.

281
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,689
I won't wreck
your precious car.

282
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,301
Here we go.

283
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:14,656
T...Takumi !

284
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,639
Taku...Taku...Taku...

285
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,011
My...my...
my Eight-Five...

286
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:21,985
Please drive gently
with my Eight-Five !

287
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:50,510
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."
