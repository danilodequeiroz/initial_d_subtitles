INITIAL

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,720
Kogoeta machi ni giniro shita kemuri
Silver smoke in a freezing city...

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,420
misugita yume no daisyou
...that's the cost of having an unachievable dream.

4
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,150
Kogoeta karada furikirenai omoi
A frozen body and unforgettable desire...

00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,820
accel funde gomakasu
You deceive yourself by stepping on the accelerator.

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:56,180
Yoru ni kowareta mama shisen tsuyoku togarasete
Although depressed in the night, your eyes are kept sharply open.

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:03,570
Dareno kimagure kara sekai sae mo owarisoude
You feel like someone's careless act could end the world.

8
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,520
"Break in 2 the nite" It's that time.

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,100
Obieta me wo shite lost in the night
Lost in the night with frightened eyes...

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,760
ochiteku yume ni dakareru
Embraced by a ruined dream.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,520
Kodoku ga kowakute missin' my heart
Scared of loneliness, I'm missing you in my heart.

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,230

I almost hurt myself.

Love me so much and knock me out.

14
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,600

If only I can give up everything...

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,260
Ai suru koto sae dekitara
...and love you...

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,500
kitto sunao ni naresou
...I can be my true self.

17
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,270
Takumi, this is for you.

18
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,840
Who from ?

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
From Takahashi Ryosuke.

20
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,690
Takahashi...

21
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,860
...Ryosuke.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,300
He's fast.

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,590
Although he lowered his power,
his exit speed is definitely faster.

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,530
He won't lose.
No way he will.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,910
``Battle ?''

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,040
Are you going
to fight someone ?

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,250
No.~~We just call a
car race a ``battle.''

28
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,450
If you don't like it,
why don't you ignore him ?

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,760
It's not that
I don't like it.

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm not going to run away, although I don't know if I can win.

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,130
Do you still think
Takumi will lose ?

32
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,300
Yes.

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,770
Even if Takumi's a genius,
he's only a high school kid.

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,000
I wonder how long he can keep up with Takahashi Ryosuke.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,570
I only have one reason for thinking that he might be able to win.

36
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,370
Takumi is Bunta's son.

37
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,160
That crazy Bunta.

38
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,210
Keisuke, I've been thinking about this for a while.

39
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,950
If I lose
on the street...

40
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,460
...I'll retire.

41
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,460
Now that I've said that, I can say that I've met two drivers who might defeat me.

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,060
One of them
is you, Keisuke.

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,420
Me ?

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,400
And the other is...

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,600
Last Great Battle

46
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,600
Cute.

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,430
Takumi !

48
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,340
Good luck, Takumi.

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,750
I believe you'll win...

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,750
...so outrun Takahashi Ryosuke and become the greatest star in Gunma !

51
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,490
Takumi...

52
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,020
Takumi...

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,770
Itsuki, he understands,
so leave him alone. {Good luck, Takumi}

54
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,890
You're late.

55
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,600
It's just before 10 o'clock.
You're as laidback as usual.

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,100
I've been waiting for you.

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,010
I don't know how someone as young as you learned all these techniques...

58
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,400
...but you impress me.

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,720
I've driven Akina's mountain passes more than anyone else, so I'm familiar with them.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,300
I don't use any
special techniques.

61
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,300
You must've misunderstood,
and think too highly of me.

62
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,950
That's interesting.

63
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,790
I guess you don't know
much about yourself.

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,020
You're interesting.

65
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,900
I want to spend more time talking to you someday.

66
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,380
Brother...

67
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,850
Let's get started.

68
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,350
It's gonna be
a fun night.

69
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,120
Alright, move your cars !

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay !

71
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,310
The Redsuns'll manage the race again.  Is that alright ?

72
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,550
Yeah.

73
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,000
Please assign some people from the Speedstars as officials.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,940
Okay.

75
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,960
Iketani, I'll be
at the finish.

76
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,000
We're counting on you.

77
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,220
Keisuke, I'll be at the
five sequential hairpins.

78
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,550
Ryosuke will win, right ?

79
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,210
We'll have our
revenge, won't we ?

80
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,750
Of course.

81
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,950
No matter how fast he is,
my brother won't lose.

82
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,550
I think so, too.

83
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,700
Well, I'm going !

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Hello, this is
Fujiwara Tofu...

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,060
Oh, it's you.

86
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,540
Bunta, I just got to Akina.

87
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,600
The galleries are packed.
You'd be surprised.

88
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,610
So ?

89
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,700
Do you think
Takumi'll win ?

90
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,980
His opponent is the street king, the fastest in Gunma.

91
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,600
I don't know.

92
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,040
If you don't have anything
else to say, I'm hanging up.

93
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,640
B...Bunta.
Bunta, wait !

94
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,480
Don't hang up on me !

95
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,400
Alright.~~Report on
each corner's condition.

96
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,950
Okay.~~This is
the first corner.

97
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,740
We're ready.

98
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,210
This is from the skating rink.
The straightaway is clear.

99
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,140
This is the No. 17 hairpin.
We're ready.

100
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,550
This is the five
sequential hairpins.

101
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,930
There's no traffic.
We're ready.

102
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,800
This is No. 6.  We're moving the gallery's cars, but it'll be ready.

103
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,690
The tension's so high,
and my throat's dry !

104
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,590
My heart's pounding !

105
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,390
The entire mountain pass
is filled with tension.

106
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,700
Yeah.

107
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,000
I wonder if
Takumi'll be alright.

108
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,480
Takumi, your opponent is one of the best Road Racers.

109
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,910
It's alright to lose,
but drive your best.

110
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,330
Takumi, good luck !

111
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,680
I believe
that you'll win !

112
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,740
There's no way
my brother'll lose.

113
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,170
But when the Eight-Six races,
unexpected things happen on Mt. Akina.

114
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,780
Excuse me, but what
about the battle ?

115
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,610
It hasn't started yet.

116
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,390
Oh, I see.
Thank you.

117
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,130
This is the starting point.
How's the finish line ?

118
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,980
Yes, it's ready.
Begin any time.

119
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,980
Okay, let's start.

120
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,750
Wait !

121
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,920
Let me count it down.

122
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,520
I want to do it for
this particular race.

123
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,660
All right ?

124
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,450
I won't let anybody else do it for the race between my brother and the Eight-Six.

125
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,210
I'm gonna count down !

126
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,750
Five...

127
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,670
...four...

128
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,630
...three...

129
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,660
...two...

130
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,000
...one.

131
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Go !

132
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,770
Go, Takumi !

133
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,630
Good, good !
The start was even !

134
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,950
Oh, Takumi's taken the lead !

135
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,890
Takumi, go for it !

136
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,880
That's my brother's style.

137
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,950
For an important race...

138
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,820
...he lets his opponent go ahead and then passes him at the critical point.

139
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,630
He's won that way before, and there's no error in his logic for the fastest driving.

140
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,700
Both are incredible !

141
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,670
What a tight twin drift !

142
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,210
Takahashi Ryosuke usually doesn't use drift that hard !

143
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,150
Both are showing
off from the start !

144
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,600
It's drift versus drift !

145
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,480
Even Takahashi Ryosuke is using drift from the very start.

146
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,860
He must be trying to win
with Takumi's specialty.

147
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,200
To keep his status
as the street king.

148
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,820
Takumi's doing great, it's
gonna be a great battle !

149
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,550
Takumi, please win,
no matter what !

150
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,810
Right, Iketani ?!

151
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,640
Yeah, right.

152
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm surprised.

153
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,680
The Eight-Six's motion is totally
different from before.

154
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,000
As I thought,
he's improved.

155
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,420
He doesn't countersteer at the end of his drift like before, but...

156
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,300
...the angle of the countersteer right after the turn-in is smaller.

157
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,870
I don't understand. How did
he eliminate that weakness ?

158
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:04,540
He hasn't raced very many times, but he's improved, one race after another.

159
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,990
I'll have to
change my simulation.

160
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,270
But that's all, and the
result will be the same.

161
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,690
My theory for the fastest
driving is correct.

162
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,260
Let me make
this clear, Takeshi.

163
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,670
I didn't park here
because I saw your car.

164
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,430
So don't get
the wrong idea.

165
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,900
I decided to come here
beforehand, so get lost.

166
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,500
No.

167
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,160
I decided to watch
the race from here.

168
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
Why don't YOU get lost ?

169
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,230
Well, the amateurs in the galleries chose famous places...

170
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,600
...like the five
sequential hairpins.

171
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,940
Right, but they can't
settle the match there.

172
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,560
This is the only place
they can make a go at it.

173
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,750
You thought so, too ?

174
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,090
I have to say it's just
what I'd expect from you.

175
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,750
Same to you.

176
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,460
Besides, there's only
us two around here.

177
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,050
Those who don't know us might think that we're close friends.

178
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,290
Disgusting.

179
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,180
Here they come.

180
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,000
Both cars are so close
to the guardrail !

181
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,700
Incredible.
It's so shocking.

182
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,060
No time to waste.
I'd better call him !

183
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,350
What a pain...

184
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,910
This is Fujiwara...

185
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,220
Hey, Bunta,
can you hear me ?!

186
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,240
Not you again...

187
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,430
Hey, listen.

188
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,350
They just passed
in front of me.

189
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,550
Both cars passed by while
drifting really hard.

190
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,350
Takumi's Eight-Six
has taken the lead...

191
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,530
...and the FC is
right on his tail.

192
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,500
Takumi's in front ?

193
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,670
That's bad.

194
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,490
Bad ?

195
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,680
Why ?

196
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,190
Think about it, Yuichi.

197
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,500
The chaser has an advantage over the one who's driving in front.

198
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,680
It's just common sense.

199
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,440
He's right.

200
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,290
The one chasing can closely watch the line and rhythm taken by his opponent.

201
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,480
Those who're skilled enough can copy that easily.

202
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,430
But if he
can pull away...

203
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,950
The one driving in front
feels a lot of pressure.

204
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,800
If your opponent follows you at the same speed, you feel mentally cornered.

205
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,750
If you can't pull away while you're driving your best...

206
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,800
...you start wondering if the opponent's far more skilled than expected.

207
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,240
Especially since Takumi has no experience in managing the pace.

208
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,390
He must be
scared by now.

209
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,280
He is ?

210
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,550
I'll call you
once it's over.

211
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,640
Will he lose...?

212
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,340
Nah.

213
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,830
They're coming !

214
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,990
My god !
I can't believe it !

215
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,270
This is corner number 24 !

216
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,400
The Eight-Six and Ryosuke's
FC have just passed by.

217
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,670
And I got the split time,
and it's incredible.

218
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,050
If they keep this pace...

219
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:53,400
...they'll shorten the Eight-Six's
last course record by 7 or 8 seconds.

220
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,710
They're gonna be faster than our race by 7 or 8 seconds ?!

221
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,740
Gimme a break.

222
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,050
So this is what my brother meant by driving his best.

223
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,950
It's almost scary.

224
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,920
Tonight's battle
will become legendary.

225
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,250
Takumi's still in front.

226
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,720
Alright.
He'll do it, Senpai.

227
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,210
Yeah, but I wonder how
long he can hold on.

228
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,290
His opponent is
Takahashi Ryosuke.

229
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,980
If Takumi finishes the race safely, I'll be satisfied.

230
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,480
He's staying right on my tail even though I'm driving at full throttle.

231
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,520
I can't shake him, no
matter how fast I drive.

232
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,300
It's no good,
I might lose this battle.

233
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,180
Takahashi Ryosuke...

234
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,190
...he's not a driver someone
like me can defeat.

235
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,200
I don't want to lose...

236
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,370
...but I'm losing.

237
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,660
Ai ni tsukarehate samayotte ta koro
Being tired of love, I wandered around...

252
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,500
I think Takumi'll win, as I expected.

253
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,300
I don't want to lose...

254
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,950
I don't want to lose this race.
Hello, this is Fujiwara Tofu Shop.
Wha ? Ganmo and Atsuage...?

255
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,950
Takumi'll win this race.

256
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,600
Takumi, go, keep up.

257
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,190
