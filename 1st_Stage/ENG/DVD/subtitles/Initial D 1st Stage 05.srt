Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,480
That's our law.

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,300
He caught me !
What's going on ?

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,880
It's driving me crazy !

34
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,000
This is from the straightaway in front of the skating rink !~~They've just passed us !

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,650
Keisuke is being pushed !

36
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,700
Akina's Eight-Six
is damned fast !

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,600
I've never seen anyone charging on Keisuke's FD so close !

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,450
I'm getting
goose bumps.

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,650
Incredible entry !

40
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,700
That Eight-Six performed an incredible entry oriented kamikaze drive !

41
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,770
That shitty old man won't call it a win unless I overtake that car.

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,950
It can't be helped, because the prize is a full tank of gas.

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,400
The attack point is the
five hairpin curves ahead.

44
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,550
End of the Dogfight!

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,670
Shit !

46
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,650
What's happening ?

47
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,750
It feels like my FD
is slower than usual.

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,940
Did the secondary
turbine stop ?

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
This is the peak.
Can you hear me ?

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,170
Ryosuke ?

51
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,250
They'll pass through
the five hairpins soon.

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,410
I want your
live report.

53
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,300
Make it as detailed
as possible.

54
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Okay.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,350
They're just around the corner.
I can hear the squealing sounds.

56
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,300
They'll pass by soon.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,250
Here comes Keisuke's FD, and
the Eight-Six is following !

58
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,800
There's no gap
between them !

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,070
That Eight-Six is incredible !
It's performing perfect braking drifts !

60
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,960
Keisuke's turn-in is slower !

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,620
He's also good at exiting !
It's so close to the guardrail !

62
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,500
They're entering the second hairpin !
There's no gap at all !

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
They're even
at the exit !

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,630
The FD is moving to the outside,
and the Eight-Six is...

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,650
He's not slowing
down for the hairpin ?!

66
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,000
What the hell
is he thinking ?!

67
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,030
The Eight-Six is heading for the hairpin at incredible speed !

68
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,710
Did his brakes go out ?

69
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,000
What the hell was that...?

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,000
Keisuke was passed
so easily on the inside !

71
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,500
That's ridiculous !

72
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,110
That doesn't tell us anything !
Explain what happened !

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,200
Well...even though
we saw it...

74
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,900
You know how a car can't turn
beyond its tires' grip speed, right ?

75
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,650
But the Eight-Six, even though it was on a disadvantageous inside line...

76
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,720
...turned strangely, just like
it was on a roller coaster.

77
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,290
I don't understand
what happened !

78
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,200
I know what the
Eight-Six did.

79
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,490
It's so silly, but no
one else could do it.

80
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,670
And it can only
happen on Akina.

81
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,310
I've found an
incredible idiot.

82
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,890
I'm looking
forward to this.

83
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,890
The one who will defeat the
downhill specialist of Akina...

84
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,860
...will be me, Nakazato Takeshi of the Myogi Night kids.

85
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,740
This is the finish line, I can hear their engines.  They'll be here soon !

86
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,650
Here they come !
Which one...?!

87
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,710
It's the Eight-Six !

88
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,050
My god,
what happened ?!

89
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,500
Keisuke's FD just showed up, but he's too far behind to close the gap !

90
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,040
The Eight-Six
is way ahead !

91
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,800
Shit !

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,450
How could my FD be
defeated by an Eight-Six ?

93
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,420
It's impossible.

94
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,200
A 350 horsepower car was outrun by a crappy Eight-Six ?!

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,450
They've crossed the
finish line !

96
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,110
Keisuke lost !

97
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,200
He did it !

98
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,200
Am I still having
a bad dream ?

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,120
I was defeated by the
Eight-Six not once but twice ?

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,750
That stupid
Takumi won !

101
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,650
Incredible...incredible.

102
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm so thrilled.
My head is spinning.

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
He did it.

104
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,170
Yeah.

105
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,310
Iketani, don't cry,
you idiot.

106
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,260
I'm so impressed.

107
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,900
Let's ask him to teach us things like drift control and line taking.

108
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,740
Put a Speedstars sticker on his car without telling him.

109
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,850
Okay, I'll do that !

110
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,770
I'll leave that
to you then.

111
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,670
We were totally defeated.
We have to admit that.

112
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,610
What about the uphill
time attack, Ryosuke ?

113
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,360
It's meaningless, even
if we win on the uphill.

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,650
By tomorrow...

115
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:30,890
...everyone will know that the Akina Eight-Six defeated the undefeated Redsuns.

116
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,400
We'll have our revenge
with my FC soon.

117
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,390
A full tank of gas...
You promised.

118
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,970
You promised, okay ?

119
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,200
So he won.

120
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,570
I knew he would
before he left.

121
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,000
The right side is where
the Eight-Six passed me.

122
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:43,260
I can't understand why the Eight-Six turned faster on the inside edge than my FD.

123
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,650
It scares me every
time I recall.

124
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,350
Maybe he really
is a ghost.

125
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,650
Keisuke, tell me
what happened.

126
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,510
Did you notice
anything strange ?

127
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,600
Come to think of it, I heard
a strange scraping sound.

128
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,000
Strange sound ?

129
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,790
I see.
I got it.

130
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,700
I can tell you why
you were defeated.

131
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,280
He used this.

132
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,940
The gutter ?

133
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
Yes.

134
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,170
He dropped his inner tires into the gutter on purpose, to withstand the centrifugal force.

135
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,200
That way, it's theoretically possible to obtain cornering force which exceeds tire grip.

136
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,200
It's such a plain, simple,
and silly idea...

137
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,970
...but you just can't do it on the spur of the moment.

138
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,200
He's probably done
it many times.

139
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,980
He must push himself
to the limit on Akina.

140
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,150
Shit !

141
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,650
Well, I like the mountain passes because things like this can happen.

142
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,500
After such a long time, I finally feel like I've found a target that truly excites me.

143
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,160
Let's suspend the
match next week.

144
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,550
We can't step up unless we
record a perfect win on Akina.

145
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,330
I'll defeat
the Eight-Six.

146
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,000
Bunta, are you there ?

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,060
It's me.

148
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,260
So hot.

149
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,340
Oh, Yuichi.

150
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Good timing.

151
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,900
I have a local
commerce meeting now.

152
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,170
Why don't you
give me a ride ?

153
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,960
Say what ?~~Are you using me as a taxi driver ?

154
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,120
I heard Takumi
was incredible.

155
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,470
That's all that Iketani and the others can talk about this morning.

156
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,900
He's not really
that great.

157
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,080
The skill level of kids these days isn't very high, is it.

158
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,040
He doesn't even like
driving a car.

159
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,650
Really ?

160
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,990
I can't believe it
since he has such skill.

161
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,960
To him, driving a car means nothing but helping the shop.

162
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,380
He's had to do it since middle school, so he doesn't feel any sense of enjoyment.

163
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,120
I see.

164
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,280
He's uninterested,
or should I say bored.

165
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,580
But I think he felt something after the race on Akina's downhill yesterday.

166
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,650
Come to think of it,
the Eight-Six was gone.

167
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,080
Where is Takumi ?

168
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,970
I'm not sure, but he seemed excited and left home early.

169
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,570
It's cold.

170
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,380
Takumi, you're
good at driving.

171
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,320
Really ?

172
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,650
I usually get
sick in cars...

173
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,000
...so I brought some
medicine with me.

174
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,550
But thanks to your driving,
I didn't feel sick.

175
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,540
This is the first time I've been in a car so long without getting sick.

176
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,910
Do you ride in
cars that often ?

177
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,100
N...not that often...

178
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,200
...like when the whole family takes a trip in my father's car.

179
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,380
Strange girl.

180
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,450
I just drove like I do to
keep the water from spilling.

181
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,880
I felt strange yesterday.

182
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,900
I noticed as I was rapidly closing in on the car ahead of me...

183
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,550
...I was getting excited.

184
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,420
I've never felt that
driving was very fun.

185
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,150
Even today, it's fun to drive with Mogi in the passenger seat.

186
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,890
Cars are pretty
interesting.

187
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,890
Hey, Takumi.

188
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,120
Hey, hey !

189
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,650
You were thinking
about something.

190
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,700
You weren't
paying attention.

191
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,710
You're so mean.

192
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:20,200
How can you leave such a cute girl alone and go into your own world ?

193
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,740
Sorry.  What were
we talking about ?

194
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,200
I asked you if you
have some girl you like.

195
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,990
Not really.

196
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,000
I do have someone I'm
interested in a little, though.

197
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,310
What about you ?

198
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,650
I have...

199
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,700
...someone I'm interested
in a little, too.

200
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,200
What do you mean ?
Don't copy what I say.

201
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:07,720
Man, I don't know how many times I was asked the same question.

202
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,280
``Who was in
that Eight-Six ?''

203
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,650
I was asked so
many times, too.

204
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,930
He defeated Takahashi Keisuke,
so he might as well be famous.

205
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:25,650
I created hype by saying that it was the Speedstars' secret weapon.

206
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,800
I have to get Takumi to join the Speedstars or I'll look bad.

207
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,200
Senpai, leave
that to me !

208
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,770
I'm Takumi's
best friend.

209
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,570
He'll listen to me.

210
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,340
Are you sure, Itsuki ?

211
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,440
Don't worry.
I know his weaknesses, too.

212
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,150
Could you let me join
the Speedstars, too ?

213
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,650
If Takumi does, then
I'll let you in, too.

214
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,650
Right ?

215
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,900
Yeah.

216
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,890
Lucky !
What a great deal !

217
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,530
But what'll you
do without a car ?

218
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,560
Thanks for asking.
I've decided.

219
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,890
Oh, you finally saved
up enough money ?

220
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,700
I'll make my dad a guarantor, and get a loan to buy an Eight-Six !

221
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,750
Takumi has a panda Trueno,
so I'll find a red or black Levin...

222
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,310
And someday, we'll be called the fastest Eight-Six pair on Akina.

223
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,650
But, Itsuki...

224
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,290
...Takumi's Eight-Six
isn't normal.

225
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:42,530
Right.  It was faster
than the 350 HP FD.

226
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,200
It must be
heavily tuned.

227
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,500
I'd like to take a look
at its engine someday.

228
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:57,310
I'd like to ride with him when he attacks Akina's downhill at full speed.

229
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,650
How about you ?

230
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,010
Yeah !

231
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,950
I wanna ride, too !

232
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,650
I'll reach an untouched zone
I can't even imagine.

233
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,910
It must be greater than
any roller coaster.

234
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,530
Damn that Takumi !

235
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,350
Wait a minute, Takumi.

236
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,050
Excuse me, but would
you take a picture ?

237
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,760
Sure.

238
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,860
Why're you taking
a picture ?

239
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,650
We came so far.
It's for our souvenir.

240
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,700
Smile, smile.

241
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,690
Ready ?

242
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,000
Sorry, one more picture.
One more picture, please.

243
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,030
That's enough.

244
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,280
It's not.

245
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,250
That white FC...

246
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,300
It's Takahashi Ryosuke.

247
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,580
There goes the Redsuns
number one driver.

248
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,190
Why's he here ?

249
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,800
To avenge his brother.
What else ?

250
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,390
It's right after
yesterday's match.

251
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,370
He must be pretty frustrated because that Eight-Six took all the fame.

252
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,650
An unfamiliar 32, isn't it ?

253
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,900
That black 32 has
a menacing presence.

254
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,970
Who's in it ?

255
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,170
My pride says "You gotta be wild and tough."
