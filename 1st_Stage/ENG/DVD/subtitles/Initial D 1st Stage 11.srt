32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,300
What's wrong with
this Eight-Six ?

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,810
These normal wheels make
me sick just looking at them.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,700
My eyes are watering !

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,060
I've never seen someone
driving an Eight-Five !

36
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,510
A brat deserves
an Eight-Five !

37
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,860
Try hard and don't let
a scooter tailgate you.

38
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,550
I'm pissed.~~I can't
let them get away.

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,940
Here we go.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,000
T...Takumi !

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,650
Taku...Taku...Taku...

42
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,540
My...my...my Eight-Five...

43
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,630
Please drive gently
with my Eight-Five !

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,840
It's alright, Takumi !

45
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,490
T...Takumi...

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,660
S...stop, Takumi !

47
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,270
Nice move !

48
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,280
W...what the...?

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,650
Hey, a car's
tailgating us.

50
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,250
It must be those
Akina brats.

51
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,440
They'll need ten years of
practice to challenge us.

52
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,910
I see.

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,900
I'll outrun it easily.

54
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,150
Takumi, it's alright !

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,200
Stop !

56
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,060
Slow down, Takumi !

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,330
I don't believe it.

58
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,990
Is this really
my Eight-Five ?

59
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,980
The car behind
us is pretty good.

60
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,650
Could it be...?

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,410
I don't know what's goin' on,
but that's the Eight-Five !

62
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,120
That's the Eight-Five we
saw at the top earlier !

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,480
It can't be !~~How could an Eight-Five keep up with me ?

64
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,600
You're right !
It's that Eight-Five !

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,550
Those brats must've
lied to us !

66
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,000
It must be...

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,140
...an Eight-Six !

68
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,740
Okay, go.

69
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,450
What's this ?

70
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,380
It doesn't accelerate,
even on the downhill.

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,650
And the tires...

72
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,920
I don't believe this.
They don't have any grip at all.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
He's incredibly fast !

74
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,520
It's so slow.

75
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,820
Oh well, I don't have any choice
but to do it that way.

76
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,450
I won't let you
pass, no matter what !

77
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,550
What the...?!

78
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,550
What the hell was that ?!

79
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,980
How I was overtaken ?

80
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,650
That's not
an Eight-Five...

81
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,890
...it must be
an Eight-Six.

82
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,850
It's a highly
tuned Eight-Six.

83
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,250
Or so I thought,
but that rolling...

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,500
Could that really
be an Eight-Five ?

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,300
We were totally outrun.

86
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,180
That Eight-Five
gave me the creeps.

87
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,550
Could that be...

88
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,720
...a ghost ?!

89
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,130
Is coffee alright ?

90
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,500
Here.

91
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,360
Arigato.

92
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,870
Now I understand
what Iketani meant.

93
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,080
Your downhill
driving is unusual.

94
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,100
Is it ?

95
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,370
I don't think so.

96
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,610
You dummy.
You just don't know it.

97
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,240
I never thought a car
could run like that.

98
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,980
My point of view
has been changed.

99
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,440
It was so shocking.

100
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,650
Was it scary ?

101
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,640
Sorry.

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,810
You don't have
to apologize, Takumi.

103
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,610
I'm so happy
I can't sit still.

104
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,090
The performance of a
car isn't the issue.

105
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,090
Good skill can make an
Eight-Five run fast like that.

106
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,650
I really like
this car a lot.

107
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll take good care of it, and I'll practice hard starting tomorrow.

108
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,650
I don't mind if
people laugh at me.

109
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,710
I like my
Eight-Five best.

110
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,200
That's right.

111
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,450
Let's ask some girls to go
driving in my Eight-Five.

112
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,450
S...sure.

113
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,650
Don't go without telling
me next time, okay ?

114
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,170
No matter what, Takumi.

115
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,560
I know.

116
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,380
Beach, girls in swimsuits...
Wait for me !

117
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,680
Alright !

118
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,080
My S13.

119
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,070
Finally, it's returned with the
same handsome face as before.

120
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm almost
ready to cry.

121
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,300
Itsuki, are you trying
to run me over ?

122
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,870
I'll start driving
hard tonight.

123
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,690
I'll lower the grade of the tires and practice drifting.

124
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,120
I'll join you.

125
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,350
Look at this sticker !

126
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,640
It's alright, isn't it ?

127
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,240
Well...I guess so.

128
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm finally a member
of the Speedstars !

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Alright, that's it.

130
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,450
And before I forget the feeling
of the downhill drive with Takumi...

131
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,530
Say what ?

132
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,240
You rode with Takumi
in his Eight-Six ?

133
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
I did...

134
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,170
...but not in his
Eight-Six though.

135
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,610
What's with that
suspicious grin ?

136
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,290
Tell us everything.

137
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,720
What should I do...?

138
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,390
Do you want to
drink oil, Itsuki ?

139
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, okay !

140
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,590
I let him drive my Eight-Five, and he pushed it hard on Akina's downhill.

141
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,960
It was incredible. I've never
had such an experience before.

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,670
My Eight-Five started skidding way before the corner...

143
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,160
...and the reflection on the windshield went by sideways so fast !

144
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,280
It's a godsent skill !

145
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,150
He drifted your Eight-Five ?

146
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,920
It doesn't
even have LSD.

147
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,300
It happened
so quickly.

148
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,270
He passed two cars, driven by jerks in the hairpins on the downhill.

149
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,680
It felt so good !

150
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,300
Do you believe
that story, Manager ?

151
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,250
Even if it's Takumi, it's
just an ordinary Eight-Five.

152
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,060
Usually, it'd be impossible,
since it's an Eight-Five.

153
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,000
You don't have
to say that much.

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,080
Even if you don't
believe me, fact is fact.

155
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,000
If he can do that
with an Eight-Five...

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,650
...he has much better
adaptability than I thought.

157
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,370
The Eight-Five and Eight-Six share the same body, so maybe the characteristics are similar.

158
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,960
I don't think so.

159
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,050
The suspension of
a normal Eight-Five...

160
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,300
...and Bunta's heavily tuned Eight-Six are like chocolate and shit.

161
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,490
They're totally different.

162
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,600
Shit ?!

163
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,770
So Takumi can push
any car to the limit.

164
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,750
Yeah.

165
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:57,400
I think he can push any car with an FR layout to its full potential.

166
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,920
They say that you can't use any tricks to drive the Eight-Six.

167
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,450
You have to master the basics in order to push it to the limit.

168
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,540
The Eight-Six is a car
that trains the driver.

169
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,000
That's what Bunta
always says.

170
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,820
The car that just passed by
had a Night Kids sticker.

171
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,070
It had the suspension
of a road racer.

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,250
If you pay attention
to how a car bounces...

173
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,600
...it's easy to tell whether the
suspension is modified or not.

174
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,800
Besides, we've seen the Night Kids so often on Akina lately.

175
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,540
I wonder why
they come here.

176
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,450
Well, their leader,
Nakazato, was defeated...

177
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,330
...so I don't think anyone
will ask for a return match.

178
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,650
It serves him right.

179
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,900
After being defeated by the Eight-Six, Takeshi won't be so influential in the team anymore.

180
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,580
What would you
like to have ?

181
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,180
Two coffees.

182
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,730
Okay.

183
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,770
Besides, Shingo, I heard that the driver of the Speedstars' Eight-Six is young.

184
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,650
I don't know about him.

185
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,910
But if I defeat the Eight-Six, then me and Takeshi's positions will be reversed.

186
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll be the fastest
of the Night Kids.

187
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,000
Are you going to
do it, Shingo ?

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,740
I know you're fast on the downhill,
but your opponent won't be so easy.

189
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,390
I'd be able to equal him by racing normally, but that'd be boring.

190
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,400
I have an interesting idea that will guarantee a 100 percent chance of winning.

191
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,550
Just wait and see...

192
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,860
...and I'll let him experience an
impressive and dangerous downhill.

193
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,130
The downhill specialist should be no one else but me.

194
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,800
The days of the
Eight-Six are over.

195
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,500
I'll push it to the bottom of the valley and send it to the junkyard.

196
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,260
Shoji Shingo of the Night Kids is the fastest downhill driver in the Gunma area.

197
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,410
Where's Ryosuke ?

198
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,940
My brother ?

199
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,800
He's staying in his room,
staring at his computer every day.

200
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,990
I don't know
what's so interesting.

201
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,850
No other Road Racer in Gunma could use a computer to race faster, except my brother.

202
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,560
Hey, Hiroshi, what do you think would happen if Akina's Eight-Six and my brother raced ?

203
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,650
What do I think ?

204
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,000
There's no way Ryosuke
would be defeated.

205
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,910
The Eight-Six's secrets are out in the open because of the last race.

206
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,650
All data was registered systematically in Ryosuke's brain...

207
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,000
...and he must've completed
a winning simulation.

208
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,950
No other Road Racer knows
cars better than my brother.

209
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,090
His technique
is outclassing.

210
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,360
I can't imagine my
brother being defeated.

211
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,290
So ?

212
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,030
But I feel like the Eight-Six
won't be defeated either.

213
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,280
Beautiful high speed drift...
Exquisite braking control...

214
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,020
He's equally exceptional.

215
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,550
As a Road Racer, driving the FR layout, maybe I'm addicted to his driving.

216
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,010
Keisuke...

217
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,930
If they race, one
of them will lose.

218
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,550
I don't want my
brother to be defeated...

219
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,650
...but for some reason, I also don't want to see the Eight-Six defeated.

220
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,890
I feel strange.

221
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,040
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,050
Did you get wet ?

223
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,820
No.

224
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,050
Pick it up
for a second.

225
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,200
Takumi, why don't we
go somewhere again ?

226
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,820
The mountains, highlands or
the beach would be nice, too.

227
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,450
It's summer break.

228
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,790
We'll share a
lot of memories.

229
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,600
Sure.

230
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,650
I can stay overnight if
it's with you, Takumi.

231
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,050
When will you
have a day off ?

232
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,350
Sunday again...?

233
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,770
The schedule's
not up yet.

234
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,470
Then why don't we go driving
on the next holiday ?

235
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,390
With your car.

236
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,060
Don't go without telling
me next time, Takumi !

237
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,270
Ummm...do you mind if Itsuki comes along, too ?

238
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
Itsuki, too ?

239
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,650
Yeah.

240
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,130
If you can arrange a girl for him, it would be great.

241
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,460
He's a nice guy, but he's clumsy about finding a girl.

242
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,410
You're a really
good friend.

243
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't mean to
be like this, but...

244
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,530
Okay, I'll talk
to my friends.

245
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,150
You will ?

246
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,790
I'll find a pretty girl
who matches Itsuki.

247
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,050
You look cool !

248
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,260
Maybe I'd better
give it a try.

249
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,190
I'm getting better at using the parking brake to let the rear skid.

250
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,350
Steering timing
is the key.

251
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,900
So you use the parking
brake to start drifting.

252
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,250
But, Iketani, when I was sitting next to Takumi...

253
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,370
...I didn't see him using
the parking brake at all.

254
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,330
Takumi has an advanced technique to initiate the load-shift by only using the foot brake.

255
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,200
We have a long way
to go to achieve that.

256
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:30,210
We've been happy skidding our cars by stepping on the gas pedal at a corner's exit.

257
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,360
But it's an elementary technique called a ``power slide,'' and it's different from a drift.

258
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,650
In a real drift, like
you see Takumi doing...

259
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,010
...you enter a corner while skidding and minimize the slide at the exit.

260
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,730
That's the fastest manner,
and it looks cool.

261
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,190
I see.
You must've studied a lot.

262
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,300
I had lots of time
until my S13 returned.

263
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,340
I studied by
reading a lot.

264
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,440
I'd like to try
the sidespin.

265
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,420
I'm getting excited !

266
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,370
I've got the hang of it,
so I'll move to the next step.

267
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,430
I'll try the sidespin in a moderate curve instead of a straightway.

268
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,660
Good luck, Iketani !

269
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,700
Watch out for
other cars !

270
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
We'll join you later !

271
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,850
It's difficult to
control a car freely.

272
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,300
I want to
be like Takumi.

273
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,230
I want to sit next
to Takumi again.

274
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:52,290
And it'd be really helpful if I let him drive my car and watch how he drives.

275
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,770
I didn't notice that.

276
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,770
Where did he come from ?

277
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,770
Dammit !

278
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,800
He tapped
my bumper !

279
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,110
Don't screw with me !

280
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,670
You've gone too far !
I won't let you pass me !

281
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
Pass me if you can !

282
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,920
Speedstars ?

283
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,290
I made it.

284
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,540
The load shifts forward just before the turn-in...

285
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,440
...so the car loses control easily by being tapped on the rear.

286
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,550
The stability of
FR cars is so poor.

287
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,530
My pride says "You gotta be wild and tough."
