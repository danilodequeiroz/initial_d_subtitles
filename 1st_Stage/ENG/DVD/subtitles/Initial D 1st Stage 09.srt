Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,130
Let's dive into the brand new trip.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,850
Hiroi sekai ni obieteru
You're afraid of a big world.

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,150

Yo! Here we go unknown world he to

26

...toki ni chuusyou toka mo nai wake ja nai kedo

Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,630
That's our law.

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,650
Why...

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm frustrated to death.

33
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,700
I want to go to
Mt. Akina so much.

34
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,580
I don't know if I like
to drive that much or not.

35
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,250
But I've been driving alone for five years, whether it was snowing or raining.

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,200
I've driven Akina
more than anyone.

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,090
Well, that's what this is all about, so let me use the car, Dad.

38
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,280
You'd better hurry, Takumi.
It's almost time.

39
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,960
There !
There he is !

40
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,540
No.
They saw me.

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,400
I can't even run away !

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,540
I'll be killed.

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,100
What're you doing, Itsuki,
sitting in the middle of the road ?

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,910
T...T...T...

45
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,270
You're in my way.
I'm gonna run over you.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,290
Takumi, you came !

47
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,850
Yeah.

48
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,080
Sorry I'm late, Itsuki.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,980
Takumi...

50
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,520
Road Racers have to accept
challenges, don't they ?

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Takumi...

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,630
Stop it !
Hey...

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Battle to the Limit !

54
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,290
He's young.

55
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,530
He must've gotten
his license recently.

56
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,200
How could a kid like him
have such techniques ?

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,120
I thought he'd
be older than me.

58
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,850
So that's the GT-R.

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,840
It's far better than good.
It's totally overwhelming.

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,240
It's got a drive train that combines the advantages of both FR and 4WD.

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm Nakazato of
the Night Kids.

62
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,450
What's your name ?

63
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,850
Fujiwara Takumi.

64
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll remember your name.

65
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,200
Let's get started.

66
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,570
Severe understeering is better during acceleration if the driver is good, you say ?

67
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,850
If the characteristics
have changed...

68
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,850
...don't you think he'll get
confused when he attacks hard ?

69
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,650
You should've told
him about that.

70
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,480
It wouldn't help,
even if I told him.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,860
He's not smart enough to change his driving habits by thinking about them.

72
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,910
Say what ?
Then he'll...

73
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,690
It's okay.
Don't worry.

74
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,850
He's not smart...

75
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,150
...but his physical
responses are good.

76
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,050
It's too late if you respond to thinking based on feelings in the seat.

77
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,200
Your hands and feet have to respond unconsciously to control the drift, right ?

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,350
You don't have to worry.

79
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,120
His sense of accelerating the car while skidding is exceptional.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,090
Even if the suspension settings are a little different, it won't bother him.

81
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,880
He'll easily find the best way and fully control the car.

82
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,420
The Eight-Six is the kind of car that can train the driver.

83
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,850
This is the finish line.
No other cars are around.

84
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,830
Anytime is okay.

85
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,980
Iketani, start when
you're ready.

86
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,710
Alright.

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,080
Let's start
the countdown !

88
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,670
Ten seconds till start !

89
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,900
I'm counting
on you, Takumi !

90
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,200
Keisuke...

91
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,710
...I'll let you observe this
battle from the VIP seat.

92
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,120
Hurry, it's about to start.

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,190
Five seconds !

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,190
Four !

95
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,190
Three !

96
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,190
Two !

97
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,300
One !

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Go !

99
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,420
The 32 has the lead.

100
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,300
But Takumi isn't
too far behind.

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
Here they come.

102
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,290
Put on your seatbelt.

103
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,850
It's the FC.

104
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,380
Takahashi Ryosuke
rocket-started his car.

105
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,390
He's gonna
follow them.

106
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,030
My god, it's gonna be a super
battle between the three ?!

107
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,540
It's gonna be the match to
determine the fastest in Gunma !

108
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,650
That GT-R driver
isn't flooring it.

109
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,160
Is he waiting for me ?

110
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,760
It wouldn't be fair to get a lead on the straightaway.

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,520
I want a battle.

112
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,970
The real start is
the corner's entrance.

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,670
Nakazato is going easy on the pedal, and waiting for the Eight-Six.

114
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,070
I hope he won't regret this easygoing attitude during the second half of the race.

115
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,000
There they are.

116
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,070
This is the first corner !
Three cars are coming in back to back !

117
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,190
Incredible.~~It's just
like Bunta said.

118
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,090
What the hell ?

119
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Is this a joke ?

120
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,050
He won't be able to follow me with that overly active ``crab walk.''

121
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,650
Watching him up close,
his drift is almost an art form.

122
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,920
Four wheel drift at full throttle with minimum counter steering...

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
Do you know
how great that is ?

124
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,640
He can control his Eight-Six like his arms and legs in a critical situation.

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,850
I can't control my
FC like he does.

126
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,850
I'm so impressed.

127
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,200
But Nakazato is
slowly pulling away.

128
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,890
Will he be able to
win this battle ?

129
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,770
This is it.
This is the feeling.

130
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,100
This high tension
of boiling blood...

131
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,420
This is a battle.

132
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,600
I'll push myself
to the limit.

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
How much longer can
you keep up with me ?

134
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,800
It's different...

135
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,330
The car's running
slightly different.

136
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,200
The car doesn't lose stability...

137
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
...and I can depress
the gas pedal early.

138
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,750
Dad must've done something
while I was working...

139
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,580
...because it wasn't like
this earlier this morning.

140
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,930
I see. That's why
he wasn't home.

141
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,630
I don't know why,
but I like it.

142
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,500
The car doesn't skid too much,
so I can step on it without worrying.

143
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,260
Incredible.

144
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,840
Unbelievable drift.

145
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,650
This is the first time I've seen someone who can let their car skid on a straightaway.

146
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,700
It's unusual. You can't do that unless the car maintains its speed.

147
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,870
What was that ?

148
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,610
That's not the kind of
drift we're used to !

149
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,500
Awesome !~~Once you've seen it,
you won't forget it !

150
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,730
Incredible !

151
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,290
The Eight-Six is still
keeping up with the 32 !

152
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,990
Takumi seems to be able to keep up with the 32.

153
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,970
I...incredible !

154
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:11,270
He can match Nakazato of Myogi and the superstar, Takahashi Ryosuke.

155
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,100
He's too good to
be my best friend !

156
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,620
He's so cool !

157
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,040
Speaking of Takahashi Ryosuke,
his FC isn't part of the battle.

158
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,390
He's just a third person.

159
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,450
Yeah, Nakazato
is the opponent.

160
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,850
I know he's at a
disadvantage racing the 32...

161
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,100
...but since it's Takumi,
he'll win, right ?

162
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,860
Yeah, he will !

163
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,250
That's right !

164
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,320
He's pulling away.

165
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,570
Nakazato's good enough
to match his big mouth.

166
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,320
He's balancing the load well,
and coping with understeering.

167
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,160
It's a driving technique to make use of the power of the GT-R.

168
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,230
It looks boring, but he doesn't drive wastefully, giving no overtaking opportunities.

169
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,850
Hey, Brother, how can
you be so laid-back ?

170
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,120
If he wins,
we'll be disgraced.

171
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,970
The battle
isn't over yet.

172
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,410
In the first half, the straightaways are relatively long, and the slopes are gentle.

173
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,920
There are many disadvantageous
factors for the Eight-Six.

174
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,450
From here, the slopes
will be steeper.

175
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,260
The downhill specialist
will show his true skill.

176
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,140
The 32 is good at these
low speed hairpin curves.

177
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,570
If I make use of the powerful brakes and slow down as I should...

178
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,850
The load shifts to the
front on the downhill...

179
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,910
...so it doesn't exhibit
understeering on acceleration.

180
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,650
And the acceleration in the lower gears is better than any other car.

181
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,270
The strongest car on the circuit is also the fastest on the public street !

182
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,990
The emblem on the rear is from the R of the unbeatable legend.

183
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,060
Can you keep
up with my R ?

184
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,160
Hey, Iketani.

185
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,500
What ?

186
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,850
I've been
thinking lately.

187
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:52,770
Is Takumi an unusual Road Racer
who's only fast on Akina's downhill ?

188
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,150
I wonder how he'd drive
on other downhills.

189
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,850
Haven't you thought
about that ?

190
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,850
Yeah, I'm very
curious about that.

191
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,020
But for now, this
battle is important.

192
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,710
Don't be defeated, Takumi.

193
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,750
Takumi...

194
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,900
Incredible.
My eyes can't focus.

195
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,430
Now he's
getting serious.

196
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,230
He's started grabbing the
gutter with the inner tires.

197
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,640
That's it.~~That's the
technique I lost to.

198
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,280
I never thought I'd
be able to see it again.

199
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,400
My brother's
stopped talking.

200
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,250
He can't relax.

201
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,060
I've ridden with him many times,
but I've never seen him drive like this.

202
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,220
He's serious.

203
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,840
He's closing in !

204
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
The Eight-Six
is catching up !

205
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,340
Impossible !

206
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,930
Fine then.

207
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,990
Now that you have done so well, my prejudice against a ten-year-old car is completely gone.

208
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,390
It's a wonderful machine with first class fighting capability.

209
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,420
I won't hold back !

210
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,820
I'm so glad he's
making this so exciting !

211
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,770
I haven't been so excited since
I switched to this car !

212
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,500
He can't catch up with the 32
at the exit of a hairpin corner.

213
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,910
Even if the Eight-Six gains on the 32 at the entrance, the gap will widen.

214
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:11,750
Nakazato's got guts, pushing so hard on the downhill with a heavy 32.

215
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,440
What ?!

216
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,030
The Eight-Six is gaining on
the 32 in a high-speed corner !

217
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,030
How can he four wheel drift so close to the guardrail going faster than 100 km/h ?!

218
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,430
It's got nothing to do
with the car's performance.

219
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,060
His brain lacks
a few lugnuts.{tightening bolts.}

220
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,250
If he makes a
mistake, he'll die.

221
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,130
I can see the secret
of his fast driving.

222
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,850
Since the Eight-Six
is underpowered...

223
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,210
...if the car loses speed, it loses time picking speed back up.

224
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,480
So he doesn't slow
down wastefully.

225
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,870
Now I understand why he managed to stay right on my butt like a ghost.

226
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,930
I can't pull away.

227
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,370
The time he stays on
my tail has gotten longer.

228
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,180
Dammit !
He's tough !

229
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,150
The distance to the guardrail is about 20 to 30 cm for Nakazato.

230
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,170
That's about right for most Road Racers,
no matter how good they are.

231
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,320
But the bumper of his Eight-Six almost rubs the guardrails...

232
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,750
...and it passes the shortest distance through the corners.

233
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,850
He's in a
class by himself !

234
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,190
How can he perform such
precise drift control ?!

235
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,490
I've been steering hard,
keeping the ABS on.

236
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,410
So the load to the front tires
is greater than I expected.

237
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,470
It's getting tough.

238
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,710
The five hairpins
are ahead...

239
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,190
What ?

240
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,700
The place where you were overtaken will be the key point.

241
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,950
I didn't expect the battle between
the 32 and the Eight-Six to be this close.

242
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,510
It's indeed a battle
to the limit.

243
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,780
Who will win ?

244
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,980
This is from the five hairpins !
I can hear the squealing !

245
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,370
My pride says "You gotta be wild and tough."
