31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,670
I was suddenly bumped
from behind in a corner.

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,050
That asshole
did it again.

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,570
Shit.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,880
I'll do it !

35
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,010
Whether it's a gumtape death match or not, I'll do it !

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,750
Takumi, wait !

37
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,900
Takumi...

38
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,910
Sorry.

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,550
Don't be taken
in by his strategy !

40
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,150
A gumtape death match
is too dangerous !

41
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,810
Don't do it, Takumi !

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,270
I won't lose,
no matter what.

Improving Genius of Drift !
Welcome.

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,050
Welcome.~~Please move
the car over here.

46
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,150
High octane or regular ?

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,710
Welcome.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,000
Need your
ashtray cleaned ?

49
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,650
Takumi's going to accept
the gumtape death match ?

50
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,600
That's bad,
extremely bad.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,100
He got pissed because
Itsuki was hospitalized.

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,180
I understand how he feels,
but it's still too reckless.

53
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,990
It's Saturday.
Where's Takumi ?

54
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,200
He took the day off.

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,710
With Itsuki in the hospital,
we're super busy.

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,650
No matter how good Takumi is, accepting a gumtape death match without practice...

57
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,650
I'll talk to
Takumi after work.

58
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,460
I have to
stop him somehow.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,130
Sorry, but can you help
us out for a while ?

60
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,270
Welcome !

61
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,300
``If you lose your sense of duty to a friend, our society will come to an end.''

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,150
It's natural for
Takumi to feel that way.

63
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,270
I don't think
he'll listen.

64
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,400
Maybe we should
let him try.

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,330
No, he's at too much of a
disadvantage against an FF car.

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm so surprised you called.
It's the first time you've called me.

67
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,240
A lot of things
made me mad.

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,800
After thinking about so many things,
I started thinking of you.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,530
I felt like
I could relax.

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm glad you did.

71
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,700
How are Itsuki's injuries ?

72
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,770
He was wearing
his seat belt.

73
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,200
It's not as bad
as it looks...

74
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,500
...but he has to go through a lot of checkups, so he has to stay in the hospital.

75
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,110
I'd better
go see him.

76
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,830
Yeah, he'll
appreciate that.

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,960
You look a little scary today.

78
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,370
Sorry.

79
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,650
You're not yourself.

80
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,330
But I like
you this way, too.

81
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,200
Takahashi

82
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,590
Brother !

83
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,990
What's up ?

84
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,650
Akina's Eight-Six...

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,840
...is going to have a gumtape death match against the Night Kids number two driver !

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,030
What ?

87
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,250
Moreover, the
opponent is an EG6.

88
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,350
What the hell
is he thinking ?

89
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,890
The gumtape death match is
a trap to kill FR cars.

90
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,400
It's only common sense that
an FR won't defeat an FF.

91
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,670
Common sense, yes...

92
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,250
But he's the driver.

93
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,880
If he drives, he'll blow mere common sense out the window.

94
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,530
What should we do ?
Should we go ?

95
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,990
Excuse me.

96
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,140
I'm closing the store.

97
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,490
I already sold out of
fried tofu and ``ganmo.''

98
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,150
We didn't come
for that today.

99
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,570
Do you know
where Takumi is ?

100
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,120
Takumi ?
No idea.

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,710
He took the Eight-Six this afternoon,
and he hasn't come home.

102
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,070
I don't know
where he went.

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,900
Sir, have you ever tried a gumtape death match before ?

104
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,100
Yeah, a long time ago.

105
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,060
What if Takumi tried it ?

106
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,860
Takumi...?
I don't know.

107
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,200
He's not very good, so he might end up at the bottom of the valley.

108
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,340
Iketani, let's go
look somewhere else.

109
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,200
Okay.

110
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,300
Sir, if he returns, tell him not to do the gumtape death match.

111
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,380
Excuse me.

112
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,650
Gumtape death match, huh ?

113
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,670
Shingo, let's get going.

114
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,690
Yeah.

115
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,320
Wait for me,
Eight-Six of Akina.

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,250
There's no way
I can lose.

117
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,530
Your Eight-Six will be
smashed into Akina's cliff.

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
Well, see you.

119
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,500
Call me again, okay ?

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Sure.

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,390
Now then...

122
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,260
So many people
are here already.

123
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I don't like
them around here.

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,020
We came here
to stop Takumi.

125
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,600
Here come the Night Kids !

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, only the
slow S13 dude ?

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,620
What happened to
the Eight-Six ?

128
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,000
Ignore him.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,990
I wonder when
Takumi will get here.

130
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,650
Shit.

131
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,390
He's gonna be here soon,
it's almost time.

132
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,950
Here comes
Akina's Eight-Six !

133
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,530
Fujiwara Tofu Shop...?

134
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,340
Is this some
kind of joke ?

135
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,410
Takumi, it's not too late.

136
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,990
Don't race in such a
ridiculous battle as this.

137
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,650
Why not ?

138
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,600
I won't lose to
a guy like him.

139
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
He's driving an FF car.
Don't you get it ?

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,800
Oh, the kid from
the other day...

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,360
You're wasting my time.

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,900
What're you
talking about ?

143
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,830
Don't tell me you're
thinking about pulling out.

144
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,260
Iketani, I won't
quit, no matter what.

145
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,320
It's almost ten.
It's about time to begin.

146
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,740
Takumi, I believe in you.
You will win.

147
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,450
Please win !

148
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,750
I wonder if
he'll be okay.

149
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,770
Maybe we should've
forced him to stop.

150
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,840
All we can do now
is trust him.

151
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,800
It's okay.

152
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,200
The finish is ready.
Shall we start ?

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
Okay.

154
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,910
I'm counting down.

155
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,290
Ten seconds.

156
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,970
Eight.

157
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,060
Seven.

158
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,210
Six.

159
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,320
Five.

160
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,280
Four.

161
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,250
Three.

162
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,330
Two.

163
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,450
One.

164
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,490
Go !

165
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,010
It's begun.

166
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,390
Don't push too hard, Takumi.

167
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,060
Shingo intentionally laid off the accelerator and stayed behind.

168
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,950
So that he can watch the Eight-Six fall from a cliff, right ?

169
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,470
Only a genius can avoid an accident in an FR under these rules.

170
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,330
That Eight-Six won't
reach the third corner.

171
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,210
Don't get
too confident.

172
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,470
The B16A engine
is a masterpiece.

173
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,590
If I'd been serious, that dated 4AG engine couldn't have outrun me during the start dash.

174
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,040
Let me see how many
corners you can clear.

175
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,730
But is it really possible to turn with one hand taped to the steering wheel ?

176
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,060
There they are !

177
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,750
Hey, the Eight-Six looks
like it's going too fast !

178
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,800
This is bad !

179
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,590
He seems slower than usual.

180
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,910
You seem quite eager, but aren't you forgetting something ?

181
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,330
There you go.
You're finished.

182
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,090
I made it.~~How lucky.

183
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,790
I thought the tendon in
my arm was about to snap.

184
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,820
H...he recovered.

185
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,610
Incredible !~~I thought
he was done for !

186
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,950
I can't watch.

187
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,290
Hey, hey, hey, where
did all your pep go ?

188
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,590
I can't just stand here.
Let's follow them.

189
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,450
T...there's no way, Iketani !
We can't catch them with our skill !

190
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,260
I'm not thinking
about catching them.

191
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,270
If Takumi is involved in
an accident and gets hurt...

192
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,800
...we have to help him
as quickly as possible !

193
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,080
Hey, I'm coming with you !

194
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,000
I see.~~I've got this
battle figured out.

195
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,650
Shit, how can he...?

196
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,710
He's clearing corners with
minimum countersteering...

197
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,510
I don't believe it.

198
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,390
The gumtape death match can't be mastered on the first try.

199
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,450
The more conservative you drive, the greater the chance you'll fall into a pit.

200
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,650
I practiced so many times keeping my hand on the steering wheel...

201
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,940
...before I could turn into the corner with tape on.

202
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,880
In a long straightaway,
engine power is more significant.

203
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,110
When it comes to a normally aspirated 1.6-liter DOHC engine...

204
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,850
...no engine in the world
can surpass the B16A.

205
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,000
The ecstasy at the sound of the engine revving up rapidly into the red zone...

206
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,350
I'd die for it.
It's awesome.

207
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,680
Do you get it ?~~If I feel like it, I can pass you anytime I want.

208
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey, hey, you'd
better hurry.

209
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,000
Why don't you
drive harder ?

210
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,000
My heart pounds every
time I clear a corner.

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,210
I'm afraid I'll see
a wrecked Eight-Six.

212
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,740
Quit saying that,
it'll bring bad luck.

213
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,270
As long as
nothing happens...

214
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,650
Yeah.

215
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,280
Besides, Takumi's
potential is surprising.

216
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,590
I can clear corners
at my desired speed.

217
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,190
The car can go faster
if I don't steer too much.

218
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,300
Shit, why doesn't my
pressure disturb him ?

219
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,780
At the beginning,
he was driving unsteadily...

220
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,120
...but his driving is getting sharper and sharper, as if he's a different driver.

221
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,200
Here they come.
They're close.

222
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,810
I guess they've
both survived so far.

223
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,350
If he couldn't get this far,
my expectations were too high.

224
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,110
Then the Eight-Six wouldn't
deserve to be my target.

225
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,010
There !

226
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,030
Oh shit, someone's
coming up !

227
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,500
Four wheel drift within the lane without crossing the centerline...?!

228
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,380
What incredible technique !

229
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,300
And he pulled
it off so easily.

230
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,310
He wasn't even fazed
by the oncoming car.

231
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:38,000
Is his hand still taped ?
Has it come off already ?

232
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,350
I think he figured out
this death match very early.

233
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,780
Which means...

234
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,780
You don't have to
depend on steering...

235
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,800
...you can also clear a corner
by shifting the weight.

236
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,650
He learned it quickly.

237
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,960
Man, what a guy !

238
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,630
He's definitely improved.

239
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,150
Shit, this is
totally unexpected.

240
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,050
Now that he's made it this far, I have to accept that it's not just luck.

241
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,720
But I'm not as
easy as Takeshi.

242
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,800
As long as I win,
I don't care how.

243
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,100
Don't blame me.

244
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,660
The Eight-Six of Akina will simply turn to scraps of metal in a junkyard.

245
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,430
Unbelievable !

246
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:23,150
After he spun out, he turned 360 degrees, and kept going as if nothing happened !

247
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,250
Damn, it's gotta be luck.
It must be coincidence.

248
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,650
Shit.

249
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,830
If it were a high speed corner,
it would've been finished.

250
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,310
It doesn't matter.
I'll win this battle.

251
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,430
It's a bummer that
I couldn't trash it...

252
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,700
...but I won't lose if it's a speed match, because I'm familiar with this rule.

253
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
I'll just outrun you.

254
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,000
Now I'm pissed.

255
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,980
He did that on purpose.

256
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,320
I won't lose to a lowlife like you, no matter what !

257
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,950
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."
