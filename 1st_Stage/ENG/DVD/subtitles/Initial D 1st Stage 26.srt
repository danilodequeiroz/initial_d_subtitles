00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,370
Kogoeta machi ni giniro shita kemuri...

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,070
...misugita yume no daisyou.

3
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,800
Kogoeta karada furikirenai omoi.

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,470
Accel funde gomakasu.

00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:55,830
Yoru ni kowareta mama shisen tsuyoku togarasete.

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:03,220
Dareno kimagure kara sekai sae mo owarisoude.

7
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,170
"Break in 2 the nite" It's that time.

8
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,750
Obieta me wo shite lost in the night.

9
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,410
Ochiteku yume ni dakareru.

10
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,170
Kodoku ga kowakute missin' my heart.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,560
Taoreru kurai ni love me so much.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,250
Subete wo suttee anata wo...

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,910
...ai suru koto sae dekitara...

15
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,150
...kitto sunao ni naresou.

16
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,370
He's staying right on my tail even though I'm driving at full throttle.

17
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,180
I can't shake him, no matter
how fast I drive.

18
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,370
It's no good,
I might lose this battle.

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,790
Takahashi Ryosuke...

20
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,780
...he's not a driver someone
like me can defeat.

21
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm losing.

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,900
New Downhill Legend !

23
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,110
Excellent. It almost
gives me goose bumps.

24
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,950
He's taking
an ideal line.

25
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,690
I can keep up with him because I'm copying his line and rhythm...

26
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,440
...but it'd be extremely difficult to do the same if I was driving alone.

27
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,070
Those who can drive fast only on straightaways are amateurs.

28
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,090
Those who've mastered the corners are middle rank.

29
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,050
An advanced driver makes the difference not in the straightaways or corners...

30
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,900
...but in the
third point.

31
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,720
To master the third point is my theory for the fastest driving's main theme.

32
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,400
I've been looking for an ideal sample for my theory.

33
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,900
I didn't expect to
find it so nearby.

34
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,540
He's scary.

35
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,110
They're close !

36
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,450
Which is it ?~~Takahashi Ryosuke or the Eight-Six ?

37
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,440
Man, how dynamic !

38
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,620
It's so impressive.

39
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,500
No good,
I can't shake him.

40
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,310
They're coming.

41
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,590
I can hardly stand still,
hearing that sound.

42
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,920
The straightaway to the five sequential hairpins is long, so they pick up speed.

43
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,500
It's gonna be a
severe braking match.

44
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,970
There they are !
The Eight-Six is in front !

45
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
Ryosuke...

46
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,020
This is the entrance to the five sequential hairpins !

47
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,850
Both cars just appeared, and the Eight-Six is in front !

48
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,420
Say what ?
The Eight-Six ?

49
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,630
You're going too fast.
You've screwed up.

50
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,860
Dammit, turn !

51
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,010
How reckless.

52
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,000
A big power car can recover
by using its power...

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,820
...but you did it
with an Eight-Six.

54
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,640
Ryosuke's FC has
taken the lead.

55
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,770
Say what ?

56
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,950
The Eight-Six understeered
at the entrance...

57
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,650
...so Ryosuke's FC
passed the Eight-Six !

58
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,660
The Eight-Six
understeered...?!

59
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,550
It's great !
Ryosuke outclasses him !

60
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,130
Ryosuke will
definitely win !

61
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,000
He's strange.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,720
He has some weak points
I'd never have expected.

63
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,890
I was going to stay behind a little longer to hide my plan...

64
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,640
Now that I'm in front, I'll be in trouble if he catches up with me.

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,790
Before he recovers, I'd better pull away and settle this race.

66
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,230
The FC just passed by, and the Eight-Six is a little behind.

67
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,660
R...Ryosuke's time
is incredible !

68
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,750
At this pace, he'll break the course record by twelve seconds !

69
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,180
Twelve seconds...?!

70
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,390
It's over.~~My brother
will keep pulling away.

71
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,760
It gives me chills,
hearing that.

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,260
Even if Takumi loses, this won't hurt his reputation.

73
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,840
Takahashi Ryosuke is
simply overwhelming.

74
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,710
The battle isn't over yet.

75
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,000
I believe that
Takumi'll overtake him.

76
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,080
But...

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,540
He's always
been like that !

78
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,120
He's reversed every difficult
situation at the end !

79
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm sure that Takumi'll
overtake him this time !

80
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,630
Please, get to
the base safely.

81
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,090
Don't think of doing something
too reckless, Takumi.

82
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,000
The most appealing part
of a rotary engine...

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,670
...isn't the power from the light and compact engine...

84
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,600
...but that it makes the car agile,  by providing an ideal front/rear weight balance.

85
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,050
I like the spirit of aiming higher, which can be felt in rotary engine cars.

86
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,060
For my pride's sake, I won't let the Eight-Six outperform my rotary engine car in corners.

87
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,510
Just like them. Both Takahashi Ryosuke and Takumi.

88
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,150
The speed is totally different from those drift kids.

89
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,350
Sayuki, what's
going to happen ?

90
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,080
Now that Takahashi Ryosuke's in front, he won't let his opponent pass him.

91
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,170
But his opponent
is Takumi.

92
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,480
Takumi hasn't given up, because he's taking a more difficult line than the FC.

93
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,810
It's the line of one
who has mastered Akina.

94
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,860
I thought that he'd pull away, but surprisingly, the gap hasn't widened much.

95
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,200
I still have a chance !

96
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,730
I'm gaining on him.

97
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,140
I'm slowly
getting closer.

98
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,000
Damn.

99
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,350
The front tires have started losing their grip suddenly.

100
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,610
Tire deterioration
because of the heat ?

101
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,000
Because I copied the Eight-Six's driving style in the first half...

102
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,350
...I put more stress on the front tires than I expected.

103
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,630
The Eight-Six is
slowly gaining on me.

104
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,430
I wonder if his
tires are alright.

105
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,850
Well, even if the tires are a little worn, it won't disturb my driving.

106
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,130
At this rate, I won't
be able to catch him.

107
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,760
I have to gain
on him fast.

108
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,230
Damn, is this my limit {best} ?

109
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Should I try it ?

110
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,780
Dad said there's another
way of using the gutter.

111
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,350
Oh, good work.

112
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,500
Dad, I found a good way to avoid skidding on a snowy road.

113
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,930
I let the tire
grab the gutter.

114
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,550
The car turns
so easily.

115
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,000
Driving in the gutter ?

116
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,550
I've used that
technique often.

117
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,790
Oh, so you've
already used it.

118
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,050
Takumi, there are two ways to use Akina's gutters.

119
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,350
The way you just found is an entry oriented method...

120
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,820
...so that you don't
understeer at the entrance.

121
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,110
There's also exit
oriented gutter driving.

122
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,740
The timing for dropping and
freeing the tires is different.

123
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,530
It's difficult.
Practice hard to learn it.

124
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,550
I've never tried it, but I have to take the chance.

125
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,750
I'd better do it.

126
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,560
Alright, let's go !

127
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,890
What did he do ?!

128
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,100
What the hell
did he do ?

129
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,320
They're coming, Shingo.

130
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,350
Judging from the squeals,
they're really close to each other.

131
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,050
It's just
as I expected.

132
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,750
This point is the only place
for settling the race.

133
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,420
Before a braking competition, there's a straightaway to pick up speed.

134
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,920
The passes are narrow, but this corner has three lanes, so they can choose any path.

135
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,990
Moreover, this is a complex corner with two turning radiuses.

136
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,040
The goal's right after this, so there're no other places to pass.

137
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,770
The one who's in front at
this corner's exit will win.

138
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,730
There they are.

139
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,250
The FC's ahead !

140
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,700
Alright, he's
right behind !

141
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,440
What're you gonna do ?
How're you going to attack ?!

142
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,580
You can't pass from outside,
so take the inside !

143
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,630
Inside or outside ?!

144
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,530
From the outside ?!

145
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,490
Takahashi Ryosuke didn't
open up the inside !

146
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,390
It was impossible
to take the inside !

147
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,720
The FC's taken the front !

148
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,390
The inside has a
definite advantage !

149
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,290
The FC's drifting outward !
Incredible !

150
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,650
His speed's too fast for the sharper curve at the exit !

151
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,360
No way !

152
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,630
Their lines are
gonna cross !

153
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,750
There !
They're coming !

154
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,450
No way !

155
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,470
Really ?!

156
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,450
How could Ryosuke lose ?!

157
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,980
It's Takumi's car.

158
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,760
Takumi...

159
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,730
It's the Eight-Six !
The Eight-Six won !

160
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,740
I don't believe it !
It's the Eight-Six !

161
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,160
With an incredible
course record !

162
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,900
My brother lost.

163
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,180
His undefeated
legend has ended.

164
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,000
Banzai !
Takumi won !

165
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,770
The Eight-Six won !

166
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,000
Incredible !

167
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,050
He did it !

168
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,350
Banzai !~~Banzai !~~Banzai !

169
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,050
Banzai !~~Banzai !~~Banzai !

170
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,240
Hey, are you
listening, Bunta ?!

171
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Takumi won !

172
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,600
Don't be so excited.

173
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,140
Of course he did.

174
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,490
It's an incredible
course record.

175
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,120
I got it.
See you later.

176
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,820
Damn.

177
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,830
So, he won.

178
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,830
That Takumi...

179
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,160
We saw an
incredible event.

180
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,750
It shocked me so much.
I don't believe it.

181
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,170
Shingo, stay away from me.

182
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,580
Those who don't know us might think that we're close friends.

183
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,850
Same to you !

184
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,420
Takumi did it. It's so cool, defeating Takahashi Ryosuke.

185
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,570
I'd better
ask him out.

186
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,730
Why don't you
ask that guy ?

187
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,580
What's his name...?

188
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,790
Iketani ?

189
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,400
Yes, that guy.

190
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
You still
have a chance.

191
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,760
Why don't we try
a double date ?

192
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,000
Uh, I have something
I'd like to ask you.

193
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,560
Would you tell me ?

194
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,110
Why did you wait for me in the middle of the battle ?

195
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,170
You think that I slowed down in the second half on purpose ?

196
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,550
That's your misperception.

197
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,060
Then why ?

198
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,780
Because you
increased your pace.

199
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,390
I tried to minimize the slowdown of my pace, because the front tires were wearing down.

200
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,410
Tires...?

201
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,370
My tires aren't an excuse, because we drove under equal conditions.

202
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,980
I lost.

203
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,770
I...

204
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't think I'm faster.

205
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,320
I can't believe
such a thing.

206
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,260
You're strange.~~I've never met someone like you.

207
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,070
Don't be satisfied with
Akina's small stage.

208
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,500
There's a bigger
world out there.

209
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,610
Fujiwara Takumi,
you are faster.

210
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,830
See you again.

211
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:30,210

I open the windows to see the night sky.

212

Your body seems to be fading in the calm wind.

213
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,510

I gently bring you closer, and give you a kiss.

214

I wonder why I feel so nervous.
