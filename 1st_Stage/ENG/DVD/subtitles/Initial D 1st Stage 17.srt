That's our law.

31
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,330
Please, Takumi.

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,020
It sounds so pathetic that
I can't tell Kenji about it...

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,480
...but I thought I needed to explain it to you so you understand.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,520
I don't like it.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,900
I can't forgive her.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,620
Takumi...

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,540
Don't think poorly of Mako.
She's a nice girl.

38
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,520
How can you
defend her ?

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't understand.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,730
You shouldn't
go that far.

41
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,600
I beg you, Takumi.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,610
Please.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,150
Hey, Takumi, you've never seen a mountain pass other than Akina, right ?

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,580
How was it ?

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,490
I wasn't driving,
so I don't know.

46
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,530
I'll race her.

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,400
R...really ?

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,550
Thanks.
You've saved me.

49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,950
I don't know if either of you
will be satisfied, but...

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,250
Takumi...

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,470
Anyway, I'll go to Usui
with the Eight-Six.

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,250
Sudden Death Death Match

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,980
Are you sure, Kenji ?

54
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,740
I can't believe Takumi is going to Usui to race against the Sil-Eighty !

55
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,670
Me neither.

56
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,160
He's not the type to go
racing in other places.

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,180
I wonder how
Iketani convinced him.

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,250
I don't know.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,600
Iketani won't give
me a real answer.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,840
We talked about what'd happen if Takumi drove on an unfamiliar mountain pass.

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,020
Yeah.

62
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,050
Well, I can understand
that he wants to see it.

63
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,070
Even so, it's so stupid racing the Sil-Eighty, the fastest on its home ground.

64
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,200
Is Takumi going
to race on Usui ?

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,060
Yes, Manager.

66
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,370
And is the
Sil-Eighty that good ?

67
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,130
It's not just good.

68
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,000
It took Usui's narrow
passes so freely...

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,350
...and it even used
a feint motion.

70
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,480
Takumi watched the Sil-Eighty with us,
so he should know better.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,510
But Takumi will win.

72
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,810
You're as
airheaded as usual.

73
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,220
Remember the guy at the gas station said that even the local guys can't defeat her ?

74
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,020
Maybe Takumi doesn't care
if he wins or not.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,340
Damn, I'm out.

76
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,460
I'd better take the Eight-Six for a spin, and go buy some more.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,480
What the hell ?

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,760
My Eight-Six turned
into an Eight-Five ?!

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,050
I borrowed the car.
I left you a substitute.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,650
Your dad must be
really surprised by now...

81
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,250
...because his Eight-Six
turned into my Eight-Five !

82
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,060
Iketani, I want to
ask you something.

83
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,360
What is it ?

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,640
Whose side are you on
for today's battle ?

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,330
Whose side...

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,650
I just set up
this battle...

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,020
Do you mean that ?

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,780
What about Takumi ?

89
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,890
Aren't you causing your friend trouble so you can look cool in front of Mako ?

90
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,370
I'm not doing that.

91
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,160
Yes, you are.

92
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,050
Let me ask you, then.

93
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,350
Do you think Takumi has the
slightest chance of winning ?

94
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,910
Well, Iketani ?
Give me a straight answer !

95
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,250
That's...

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,620
There's no way
he can win.

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,930
He only knows Akina's
mountain passes.

98
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,520
He's never driven Usui's passes,
and it's such a difficult course.

99
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,550
He has wonderful technique...

100
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,810
...but sometimes technique doesn't mean a lot in racing.

101
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,100
There's familiarity with
the course, for example.

102
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,210
Without practice, it won't be a fair race, even for Takumi.

103
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,480
You know that.

104
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,650
W...well...

105
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,430
Of course, any man is more or less powerless with the one he loves.

106
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,750
For my last memory
of this summer...

107
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,450
...would you let me race against Akina's Eight-Six on Usui's mountain pass ?

108
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,820
But don't let your friend down by losing yourself to a woman.

109
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,650
Haven't you forgotten that Takumi and his Eight-Six saved us at an important moment ?

110
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,900
Akina's Eight-Six
is our pride.

111
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,800
If you don't
cancel this battle...

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,220
...our friendship
is over.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,010
Kenji, I understand.

114
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,790
Sorry. I should've talked
about this with you earlier.

115
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,030
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

116
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,040
I don't understand why you're going to quit racing.

117
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:01,760
We were obsessed when we started
racing two years ago.

118
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,990
Our goal was to be
the best in this area.

119
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,720
It's still fun today.
Or isn't it ?

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,500
I don't know how
to say this...

121
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,390
...but I don't feel the tension these days like I used to.

122
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,330
I don't know why.

123
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,660
I thought,
``It's time.''

124
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,090
I think it's
time to quit.

125
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,000
Is it ?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,280
I really don't
understand very well.

127
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,390
I want a boyfriend...

128
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,930
I want to find
my love, like you.

129
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,280
You don't have to quit
racing to find a guy.

130
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,000
I do.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,060
I don't think you can
understand how I feel.

132
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,470
You have someone you
like, don't you ?

133
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,610
Honestly speaking,
I had a guy I admired.

134
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,000
I didn't know.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,130
My leading question worked.
You never told me about it.

136
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,600
Of course you
didn't know.

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
He doesn't live nearby.

138
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,860
I was dreaming of him
from a distance.

139
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,750
What's wrong with you ?

140
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,420
You're almost like a romance novel character who's extremely modest.

141
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,660
You're twenty already.

142
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,850
It doesn't matter.

143
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,030
I was happy just
dreaming about him.

144
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,950
``Dreaming...?'

145
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,670
You should look
at reality.

146
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,150
Sorry...

147
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:04,760
I want to see what we've accomplished in the last two years in my last race.

148
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,000
To put a period
to it, right ?

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,730
Sounds thoughtful of you.

150
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,560
He's good enough
to be our opponent ?

151
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,780
Yes.

152
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,430
Let me tell you this.

153
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,130
If we race on Usui's mountain passes, we can't lose no matter who the opponent is.

154
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,120
Or I won't be satisfied.

155
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,230
I know.

156
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,670
We have to win.

157
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,220
Even if it's against
Akina's Eight-Six.

158
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,360
Yes, definitely.

159
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,870
So, why don't we cancel the race, since you're not personally interested ?

160
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,620
Iketani and I'll talk to them, so you can turn around at the next exit.

161
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,330
Do as he says.
Sorry about this, Takumi.

162
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,340
Forgive him, Takumi.

163
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,950
Kenji, I'm not going
to turn around.

164
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,210
Takumi.

165
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,810
I want to race,
so I'm going.

166
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,680
It's my own wish, and I'm
not going to turn around.

167
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,640
Takumi...

168
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,650
But, Takumi, you know how good Mako is, you saw her with us.

169
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,450
There're too many
disadvantages for you.

170
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,150
Even though it's you, you
won't be able to win.

171
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,950
I know.

172
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,590
I'm not worried
about the result.

173
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,720
Don't say such things so casually.

174
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,750
Akina's Eight-Six is famous now, and you should protect your reputation.

175
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,390
I don't like it.

176
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,410
I've been winning because I'm familiar with the course.

177
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,690
But I don't like the fact that the fame is greater than my skill.

178
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,690
I'd feel good if
such fame went away.

179
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,650
H...hey.

180
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,980
Why...

181
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,150
I'm going.

182
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,080
I want to push as hard as I can on a mountain pass I've never driven.

183
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,540
Sorry about my
harsh words, Iketani.

184
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,750
There's nothing to say after
hearing that from Takumi.

185
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,350
Right.

186
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,520
He's so weird.

187
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,000
He's different from us.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,470
I don't know if he's great
or simply airheaded.

189
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,920
I don't get it.

190
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,350
Tires are okay.

191
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,810
Tires with this much wear
will grab the road best.

192
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,970
No need to change
the suspension settings.

193
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,810
I think the current
setting is the best.

194
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,290
If you say so,
it should be.

195
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:06,500
I think you know this, but when it comes to a duel, you should avoid overusing drift.

196
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,130
And the key is to decide at each corner whether to skid or to grip.

197
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,220
Especially on Usui, where there are many consecutive corners.

198
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,400
I'm with you, so you should trust your technique and push hard.

199
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,350
No one can defeat you.

200
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,150
I'll prove that,
so leave it to me.

201
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,470
The two of us
drive as one.

202
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm getting excited, Sayuki.

203
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Tonight, my tension
is so high.

204
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm looking
forward to it.

205
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,830
I'm excited to see how the battle'll go and what kind of driver we're going to race against.

206
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey, Takumi, how're
you going to race ?

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,590
If you have
a plan, tell me.

208
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,180
I don't have one.

209
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,000
How can you
say that ?

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can't you
do something ?

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,010
I don't want
to see you lose.

212
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,800
How about this ?

213
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,960
Usui is narrow and there
are no straightaways.

214
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,900
Yeah.

215
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,990
So get the jump on her
and take the lead.

216
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,050
What do you mean ?

217
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,640
Then, keep blocking so that you can't be passed, and you'll be able to win.

218
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,240
That's too cowardly.
How can I do that ?

219
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,730
But, if they get ahead of you,
they'll pull away, and it'll be over.

220
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,020
You're right.

221
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,430
Any good ideas ?

222
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,470
Both are just cars
with four tires.

223
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,390
Are you reeeeeeeeeeally the
driver of the Eight-Six ?!

224
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,550
I don't believe this.

225
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,050
How old are you ?

226
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm eighteen.

227
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,750
Eighteen ?

228
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,380
A high school kid ?
Give me a break.

229
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,320
You're only twenty,
so you're young, too.

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
And they're women. {they're not people, they're WOMEN ! bg =}

231
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,980
We can't lose to
a younger kid, Mako.

232
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,950
Well, let's get
down to business.

233
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,750
These are the
race rules.

234
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,750
It's not fair to start
side by side here...

235
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,640
...because the one who's in front of the other has an advantage.

236
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,740
We don't want to argue
for a jumpstart or such.

237
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,060
My idea won't work.

238
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,290
So, how do we do it ?

239
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,660
Let one chase the other.
Get it ?

240
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,440
It's run and catch.

241
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,210
If the frontrunner runs away from the chaser, the front wins.

242
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,150
If not, switch positions and try again until the game is settled.

243
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,370
It's a sudden death
death match.

244
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,620
How's that ?

245
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,980
Fine.

246
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,490
We're locals, so we'll let you choose your position for the first run.

247
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,430
Choose front or rear.

248
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,510
Well...

249
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,920
Wait a minute.

250
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,120
Come over here, Takumi.

251
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,330
With this rule, you should take the front for the first heat.

252
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,320
Yeah, there'll be a second heat,
so you'll have a chance to practice.

253
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,500
Even if you lose in the second heat, you won't look too bad.

254
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,520
I know he'll take the
front for the first heat.

255
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,320
We'll win the second heat.
Don't worry.

256
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,000
Thanks for being concerned about me and giving me advice.

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,290
But I don't like it.

258
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,090
What're you talking
about, Takumi ?

259
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,010
I'll take the rear
for the first heat.

260
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,180
Say what ?!

261
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,000
Think it over, Takumi.
Okay ?

262
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,530
This is my battle, isn't it ?
Let me decide.

263
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,860
B...but...

264
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,350
I'll take the rear.

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,550
Rear...

266
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,210
Is he taking us lightly,
or is he just plain stupid ?

267
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,570
Okay, I'll leave
him way behind.

268
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,600
Who the hell is that ?
I'm busy.

269
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,830
This is the
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

270
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,330
Hello, is that you, Bunta ?

271
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,520
Oh, it's you.
I'm busy.

272
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,170
I'm worried about something.
It's about Takumi...

273
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,120
Are you ready ?
Let's start.

274
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,440
...went to Usui to race ?
I see.

275
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,190
``I see ?''
Is that all you can say ?

276
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,140
Don't you worry
about him ?

277
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,000
Nope.
He's my son, you know.

278
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,980
We'll start slowly,
so relax and follow us.

279
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,310
As soon as we clear the first corner, we'll drive with all our power.

280
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,330
That's the sign of the
start of the race.

281
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,280
Is that all ?
Nothing else ?

282
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,000
That's all.

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm busy, so don't call me
about such minor things.

284
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,510
H...hey, Bunta...

285
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,280
Takumi, I was stupid.

286
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,430
I realize it now.

287
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,700
I knew it all along.

288
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:35,000
Even though you don't like it, you're doing this to save face for me, aren't you ?

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,350
I really regret this.

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,750
You're the pride of
all Akina's Road Racers.

291
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,390
I've done something
I can't make up for.

292
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,390
I don't want to see you
lose because of my stupidity.

293
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,500
Takumi won't lose !

294
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,960
But in reality,
it'll be difficult.

295
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,490
It's my fault.

296
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,570
Iketani...

297
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,470
Senpai...

298
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,150
...I chose the rear because
I have an idea.

299
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,140
What ?

300
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,250
I don't know if I can win, but I'm not thinking {planning on} about losing.

301
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,600
Takumi, do you have a plan ?

302
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,770
It's not really a plan.

303
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,220
It's just
a simple idea.

304
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,320
What is it, Takumi ?

305
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,610
Hey, tell us.

306
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,610
No matter how fast they are,
their car can't fly or anything.

307
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,200
Both are just cars
with four wheels.

308
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,180
Four...?

309
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,420
So, if their car can take a corner at a particular speed, I think I can do it, too.

310
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,350
That's what
I'm thinking.

311
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,110
I see.

312
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,520
It makes sense.

313
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,070
That's impossible.

314
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,390
We're going.

315
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's go, Mako.

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,090
Let's finish this battle
on the first try.

317
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,600
Okay, Sayuki.

318
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,650
I'll show you the
best race ever.

319
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,430
Both cars blasted
off at full throttle.

320
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,920
Takumi's first visitor race
has finally begun.

321
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,540
But this battle's conditions are so tough, even for Takumi.

322
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,870
Takumi will
definitely win !

324
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,610
Ai ni tsukarehate samayotte ta koro
Being tired of love, I wandered around...

Strongly, strongly I hold you tight.

Tatta hitotsu kono omoi wo shinjitu da to ieru
