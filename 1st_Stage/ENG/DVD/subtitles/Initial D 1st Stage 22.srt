Dareno kimagure kara sekai sae mo owarisoude.

7
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,370
"Break in 2 the nite" It's that time.

8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,950
Obieta me wo shite lost in the night.

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,610

...kitto sunao ni naresou.

16
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,950
Is there a good cure to save Takumi from his lovesickness ?

17
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,050
Today's Friday, so September 15th
is still a week away.

18
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,900
We're lucky that
it's not tomorrow.

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,350
By the way, there's a race between the Redsuns and the Myogi Night Kids.

20
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,830
That's it !

21
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,050
We'll drag Takumi out there,
and watch the battle !

22
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,900
He'll be stimulated
and recover !

23
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,020
That's a good idea !
That's it !

24
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,580
Why don't we knock him out and save him from his lovesickness.

25
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,050
Severe Hill Climb

26
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,850
Hey, Dad,
I've been thinking.

27
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,940
What is it ?

28
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,380
I drove on Mt. Usui
the other day.

29
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,850
At first, I thought Usui was totally different from Akina.

30
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,700
But...I don't know
how to say this...

31
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,450
They seemed almost the same after I started driving.

32
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,570
Well done.

33
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,850
``Well done ?''

34
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,950
Akina and Usui are
totally different...

35
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,550
...but you simply drove
in the same manner.

36
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,250
You tried what you do on
Akina in a different place.

37
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,980
Well, take care
of the delivery.

38
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,850
Yeah.

39
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,700
Try what I do on
Akina in other places...

40
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,350
I know what you
meant to say...

41
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,780
...just a little.

42
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,430
I'd better take a
nap when I get home.

43
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,200
Takumi looks totally bored.

44
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,940
Alright, it's the time
to proceed with the plan.

45
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,780
Hey, Takumi !
Takumi !

46
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,150
Hey, big news.
Don't be surprised !

47
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,720
The Redsuns and Night Kids are racing !
And it's tonight !

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,670
Wha...?

49
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,740
Don't give me ``wha,''
will you ?!

50
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,850
You're racing against
Takahashi Ryosuke next week...

51
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,780
...so you shouldn't
miss this.

52
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,110
Right ?

53
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,090
Alright, we've decided.

54
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,550
And it'd be a waste of gas
to go in two cars...

55
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,500
...so we'll go in
your Eight-Six ?

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,510
My...

57
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm so excited !

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,060
Aren't you excited ?!

59
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll be at the usual place at
seven o'clock tonight...

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,220
...so make sure you borrow
the Eight-Six, okay ?!

61
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,700
As I thought,
there're so many people.

62
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,760
Have you seen
Takumi and Itsuki ?

63
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,390
No.~~I guess they
aren't here yet.

64
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,100
I let Itsuki handle it, but I'm worried if they'll make it.

65
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,080
What're you doing, Takumi ?
It's gonna start soon.

66
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,320
Since you didn't want to take the highway, we got lost.

67
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,470
You're so stingy.

68
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,800
What're you talking about ?

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,380
You wanted to save gas and
didn't drive your Eight-Five.

70
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,630
Man, I've never heard of a Road Racer who's bad at directions.

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,320
It must be
because of a girl.

72
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,400
Okay, I got it.

73
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,940
Hurry, we don't
have much time.

74
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,830
I've been waiting.

75
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,550
The hero always
arrives late.

76
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,000
Myogi's valley is deep.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,570
You'd better be concerned
about your life.

78
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,860
Can it.~~Aren't you
shaking from fear ?

79
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,800
I'll defeat
you so easily.

80
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,580
No one in the Night
Kids can match me.

81
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,850
I hope your overconfidence
doesn't kill you.

82
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,450
We'd better start
before the rain comes.

83
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,250
Right.

84
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,900
The Eight-Six !
It's Akina's Eight-Six !

85
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,790
The Eight-Six ?

86
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,610
Wow, look at all the
people in the galleries...

87
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,820
First, let's
find those two.

88
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,030
I know.~~Since there are
so many people, it's tough.

89
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,750
Where should we
park the car ?

90
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,290
Should we go to the peak ?  There's a big parking lot there.

91
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,740
Okay.~~I'll head for
the peak for now.

92
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,300
So he's come after all.

93
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,520
It excites me whether
I like it or not.

94
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,200
Eight-Six...

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,640
...I'll show you how
much I've improved.

96
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,100
It's the Eight-Six.

97
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
From Akina ?

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah.

99
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,650
So, that's the one.

100
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,200
Hey, Takumi,
I noticed earlier.

101
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,550
Don't you think
they're watching us ?

102
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,610
Dunno...

103
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,120
``Dunno...?''
We really stand out...

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,820
...because Akina's
Eight-Six is famous.

105
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,480
Everyone thinks
so highly of you.

106
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I was right about
coming in the Eight-Six.

107
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,130
What're you talking about ?

108
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,150
Alright.

109
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,130
~~~Forward.

110
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,870
Alright, alright.

111
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Okay.
No oncoming traffic.

112
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,180
Starting the countdown !

113
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,040
Five...

114
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
...four...

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,260
...three...

116
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,140
...two...

117
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,320
...one.

118
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Go !

119
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,930
What an incredible
rocket start.

120
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,290
Keisuke'll win.
I know it.

121
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,260
Don't lose.  We can't disgrace ourselves by losing on our home course.

122
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,850
Takahashi

123
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,890
It's begun.

124
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,000
Rain...

125
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,730
The FD's greatest advantage
is its manueverability.

126
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,470
Don't forget that, Keisuke.

127
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,580
Hey, Takumi, don't you think Myogi's
passes are similar to Akina's ?

128
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,200
Are they ?

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,240
I'd say that they
remind me of Usui.

130
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,340
What ?!
They're nothing like it.

131
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,890
It's no use. His sickness is deeper than the Marianas Trench.

132
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,240
Alright, Takumi,
look carefully.

133
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,540
It's not as narrow as Usui, and this dynamic climbing path is very similar to Akina's.

134
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,420
That's not what I mean.
The rhythm is similar.

135
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,800
``R...rhythm ?''

136
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,910
He's tough.

137
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,230
The FD's fast
in the corners.

138
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,760
I didn't expect anyone to keep up with my R and I on Myogi.

139
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,200
He's started
steering hard.

140
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,560
Is he going to increase the pace to try and outrun me ?

141
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,490
If you do that on the downhill, the tires will definitely lose grip.

142
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,620
This's the midpoint,
and they just went past.

143
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,540
The 32 is ahead,
but the gap is minimal.

144
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,100
I see.

145
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,900
Tell me one thing.

146
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,930
Is Nakazato pulling away from Keisuke at the corner's exit ?

147
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,850
Well, he's slightly slower at the exit, but he's keeping up overall.

148
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,850
His driving is very smooth.

149
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,750
It's very different from
Nakazato's drastic driving.

150
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,950
Okay, I got it.
Thanks.

151
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,680
If you're doing that,
you've improved, Keisuke.

152
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,220
The R32 is ahead, but
there's no gap in between.

153
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,500
They just passed us.

154
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,080
The 32 is ahead, but the
FD is right behind it.

155
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,830
Takeshi seems to
be doing alright.

156
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,150
He's been practicing so hard.

157
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,890
Yeah, he's been totally different since he was defeated by Akina's Eight-Six.

158
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,040
I've considered him my enemy even though we're on the same team, but now...

159
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,650
...when I think about him driving for our pride, my chest aches.

160
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,330
I've never had
a feeling like this.

161
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,960
Here comes the 32.
The FD's right behind it.

162
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,590
Please win, Takeshi.
I'm counting on you.

163
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,250
I can only
hear the sounds.

164
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,460
They're taking so
long to get up here.

165
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,550
What ?

166
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,190
Rain.

167
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,570
This is bad. It's in the middle of an attack at max speed.

168
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,370
The beginning of a rainstorm is the most dangerous.

169
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,540
The dust and sand on the asphalt are stirred up by the rain...

170
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,940
...and the road'll be
extremely slippery.

171
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,560
You can lose
grip very suddenly.

172
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
It's started raining.

173
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,270
Damn, the goal
is so close.

174
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,940
The beginning of the
rain is most dangerous.

175
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,590
When you skid, it happens
without any warning.

176
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,310
It's getting heavier.
I hope it won't be canceled.

177
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,430
Say, Itsuki...

178
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,100
...the goal is over there, which means this is the last corner, right ?

179
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:03,800
That's Myogi's peak, so this short section just before the goal is slightly downhill, isn't it ?

180
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,060
So, the last
part is downhill...

181
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,800
Here they come !

182
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,540
Now it's time to
settle this match !

183
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,340
Impossible !~~You won't be able to turn at that speed !

184
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,200
That idiot's gonna
crash into the cliff !

185
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,100
I can do it.
I have feedback. {a feeling}

186
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,250
My FD's telling me to go.

187
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,610
It's coming this way !
Run !

188
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,950
Goal !
The FD won !

189
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,410
Cool !~~It's so awesome !
Takahashi Keisuke is incredible !

190
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,800
This is the first time...

191
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,060
I've never been excited by watching someone else race before.

192
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,650
I can't stand still after watching something as incredible as that.

193
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,830
You were lucky,
Takahashi Keisuke.

194
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,410
No, it was because
of my skill.

195
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,540
Say what ?

196
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,200
The last corner
was downhill...

197
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,850
...so I knew that the key would
be the front tires' condition.

198
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,250
Didn't you wear down your tires, so the feedback from the front felt sluggish ?

199
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,550
I saved my tires while
I kept pace with you.

200
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,550
It was because of the
difference in our abilities.

201
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,240
Keisuke, that's
just like you !

202
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,460
What should we do
about the downhill ?

203
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,150
We'll have to cancel it
because of this heavy rain.

204
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah...

205
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,170
Then, Keisuke, let me race
against Akina's Eight-Six.

206
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,090
What ?

207
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,550
It's okay since it's not
our home course, right ?

208
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,160
This isn't his home course either,
so the conditions are equal.

209
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,840
Hey !

210
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,740
Senpai...

211
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,390
Who's he ?

212
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,550
I don't know.

213
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,550
Kenta...

214
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,160
You're Fujiwara
Takumi, aren't you ?

215
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm Nakamura Kenta
of the Redsuns.

216
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,420
What do you say ?~~Will you accept my challenge to a rain battle ?

217
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,990
Hey, Kenta, without checking
with my brother...

218
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,880
Let's ask the galleries, Keisuke.

219
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,670
Guys, do you want to see a rain battle between me and the Eight-Six ?!

220
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,550
Go for it !

221
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,020
Do it !

222
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,470
T...this is bad.

223
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,610
He can't say no
in this situation.

224
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,370
B...but Takumi has a battle against Takahashi Ryosuke next week.

225
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,200
I'll race you first.

226
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,190
If you lose to me, you don't deserve to race against Ryosuke.

227
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,610
Don't just stand there.
Say something.

228
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,550
I'm confident
driving in the rain.

229
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,550
Don't tell me you're
scared of the rain.

230
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,200
No, the timing's bad.

231
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,150
He's not in
the right mood...

232
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,460
Okay, I'll do it.

233
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,860
W...wait...

234
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,440
No one can
stop them now.

235
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,740
But...

236
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,280
The Eight-Six isn't
only our target.

237
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,040
All Road Racers want to race against the Eight-Six.

238
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,220
You understand that,
don't you ?

239
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,160
That's what I want.

240
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,630
When it comes to the downhill in the rain, we can compare our techniques.

241
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,810
Go get your Eight-Six,
and pull up next to me.

242
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,500
Come with me, Itsuki.

243
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,150
Am I riding with you ?

244
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,270
If I leave you here, I'll have to come back and pick you up.

245
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,780
I don't want to waste my time, so let's go home after we get to the base.

246
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,110
Okay, I'm getting in.

247
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,350
Hold it.

248
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,020
Sorry, Itsuki, but would
you sit in the back ?

249
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,360
In the back ?
Okay.

250
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,910
Is there any
reason for this ?

251
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,200
Well, maybe there is
and maybe there isn't...

252
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,930
What do you mean ?
Aren't you sure yourself ?

253
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,810
How should I hold my
body during drift ?

254
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,240
I'll leave
it up to you.

255
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,280
Up to me ?~~Hey !

256
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,950
It's just a short ride to the base, so hang in there, okay ?

257
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,110
They're not gonna cancel !
There'll be another downhill race !

258
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,160
The Eight-Six...
Akina's Eight-Six is gonna race !

259
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,100
Okay,
no oncoming traffic.

260
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,450
Let's start.

261
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,020
This is totally unexpected.

262
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,140
Yeah, but there was
nothing we could do.

263
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,410
Please watch me, Keisuke.

264
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,860
I like rain.

265
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:51,780
Before I joined the team, when I practiced drifting alone, I chose rainy days.

266
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,660
I was poor, so I liked driving in the rain because the tires didn't wear out so quickly.

267
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,230
I like your confidence,
but don't underestimate the rain.

268
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,680
I have more experience in
the rain than anybody else.

269
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,300
Don't worry. If it's raining,
I have the advantage.

270
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,280
I'll win, because the
rain is on my side.

271
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,070
Hey, Takumi, you don't
look very nervous.

272
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,510
Are you alright
with this rain battle ?

273
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,110
I don't know.

274
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,190
I can't go as fast in the rain,
so I'll just drive like I normally do.

275
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,630
I don't know if I can
drive fast or not.

276
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,850
I'll try not to push
myself too hard.

277
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,540
If I damage the car,
Dad'll hit me.

278
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,330
I see.

279
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:45,350
But if he loses, what'll happen to the battle with Takahashi Ryosuke ?

280
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,690
I'll start the countdown.

281
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,720
Five...

282
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,620
...four...

283
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,590
...three...

284
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,640
...two...

285
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,710
...one.

286
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,660
Go !

287
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,450
You call this normal ?!

Yes, I'm confident.

Besides, Keisuke's watching,
so I have to win !

306
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,380
But your opponent is the Eight-Six, and even Keisuke couldn't beat him.

307
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,050
That's why I want to avenge him !
It's for Keisuke !

But it's a route you've
never raced on before.
