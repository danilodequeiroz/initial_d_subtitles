33
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:54,776
That was dangerous !

34
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:56,325
How dare you
drive like that !

35
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,124
Hey, you...

36
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:03,283
Hang on !
Are you alright ?

37
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:08,222
Sorry about my
carelessness.

38
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:11,091
I'm sorry...really...

39
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,990

What ?!

42
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:27,017
Iketani had an accident ?!

43
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,317
When ?!

44
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:31,365
Last night he hit the guardrail driving the downhill on Akina.

45
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:32,925
How is he ?

46
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:34,765
Thank you very much.
His injury isn't too serious.

47
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,415
Just minor whiplash.

48
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:40,273
But he's really
torn up about it.

49
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:43,042
His car was heavily
damaged, too.

50
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,912
Then what about
the race on Saturday ?

51
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,380
It's hopeless...

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,380
Anyway, we have to find a
substitute for Iketani somehow.

53
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,449
Welcome...

54
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,758
Oh, Iketani...

55
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,438
Is it alright to
be walking around ?

56
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:02,357
Yeah, it's okay.

57
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,397
Where's my car ?

58
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,507
In the back garage.

59
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:06,906
Nothing's been done yet.

60
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:09,765
We can't start until
we get all the parts.

61
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,744
Excuse me.

62
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,594
I want fried tofu.

63
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,494
Coming.

64
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:53,583
Thanks...

65
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,483
You had an accident ?

66
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,792
Yeah...

67
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,191
There isn't much
time till the race.

68
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,491
What're you
going to do ?

69
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,501
I came to ask you a favor
about that, Mr. Fujiwara.

70
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,530
Favor ?

71
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,740
Yes.

72
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,589
Can you drive in the race instead of me the day after tomorrow ?

73
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,658
I beg you, Mr. Fujiwara.

74
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:18,886
My neck...

75
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,506
Don't die.

76
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:24,885
You can understand how
a Road Racer feels, right ?

77
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,444
The local drivers
can't be defeated !

78
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:33,423
Hey, even if I do, I'd just be an old man in the wrong place.

79
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,731
I grew up driving Akina...

80
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:41,730
...so I can tell that those Redsuns guys are looking down on all of Akina's Road Racers.

81
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,430
{SOREDE}That's why I'm
so frustrated !

82
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,358
{AKINA}I want to show them there's a skilled Road Racer on Akina.

83
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,628
Mr. Fujiwara, you can
do that because...

84
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:55,627
...you've defeated Takahashi,
the fastest of Akagi, once already.

85
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,915
Please, Mr. Fujiwara !

86
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:10,362
What is it ?
We're closed for today.

87
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:15,870
Don't be so rigid.
Fill it up with high octane.

88
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,270
How cheeky...

89
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,570
High octane for the
Eight-Six, you said ?

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,088
It was you who told Iketani
that ridiculous rumor.

91
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:30,567
Yeah, I didn't mean
to tell a lie.

92
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,617
So, what about it...?

93
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:36,615
He came over today with
bandages and neck brace on.

94
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,855
He asked me to drive
instead of him.

95
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,854
I can't hate that
kind of guy, though.

96
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:45,712
If you don't, then
why not drive instead ?

97
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,902
Iketani's a nice guy.

98
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:49,712
Forget it.

99
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:53,311
It's like an adult poking
his nose in a kids' fight.

100
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,340
That's not my style.

101
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,309
Then why don't you send
a kid to a kids' fight ?

102
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:02,129
Are you talking
about Takumi ?

103
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,708
Yeah.

104
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,857
He's really good,
isn't he ?

105
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,667
Not yet...

106
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:13,276
...but if it's Akina's downhill,
he's good enough not to lose to anyone.

107
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,774
Well, he can't
defeat me, though.

108
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:17,524
Here comes your
fighting instinct.

109
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:21,103
I wonder what made
him so stubborn.

110
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:24,922
Even if he's asked, he's not the kind who'll accept so easily and drive...

111
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:30,981
Well, I'll come up with a plan for the sake of the bandaged Iketani.

112
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,686
Don't break your promise.

113
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:53,725
I hate people who smoke
and break promises.

114
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:58,493
Let me use the
car on Sunday, okay ?

115
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:00,193
Sunday...?

116
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:01,243
You can't.

117
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:02,692
Why not ?

118
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,801
I'll do the delivery
in the morning as usual.

119
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:07,141
That's not it.

120
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:10,650
I have a meeting of the Society of Commerce on Sunday, so I need it.

121
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,690
Really ?

122
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,688
This is bad.

123
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:16,688
I really need the
car this Sunday.

124
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,177
It must be a girl.

125
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,187
None of your business.

126
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:26,035
Don't be so stubborn,
and let me use it...

127
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,905
...because the car isn't
that great for your use.

128
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,875
I'll go without
asking, okay ?

129
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,604
The car won't
run without a key.

130
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:35,243
I'll put it on a string
and wear it around my neck.

131
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:37,272
That's mean.

132
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:40,032
If you're so desperate,
I can consider it.

133
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,112
Really ?

134
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,580
But I have
one condition.

135
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,110
Condition ?

136
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,279
Saturday night, beat the pants off a smartass kid who claims to be the fastest on Akagi...

137
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,108
...on Akina's downhill.

138
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,697
H...how come ?

139
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:58,727
Then I'll let
you use the car.

140
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,886
Plus, you get a
full tank of gas.

141
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:03,745
Full tank of gas...

142
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,574
Full tank of gas...

143
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,274
That's so irresistible...

144
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,002
...'cause I'm
almost broke.

145
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,872
What're you going to do ?

146
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:19,021
L...let me think about
it for a while.

147
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,930
Fine, think as
much as you want.

148
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,419
Takahashi

149
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:42,794
I'm coming in.

150
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,814
Oh, Keisuke,
good timing.

151
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:49,033
I wanted to ask
you something.

152
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,883
What is it, Brother ?

153
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:54,261
It's about the Eight-Six
you saw on Akina.

154
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:57,091
Can you logically explain
why it was so fast ?

155
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:00,910
Oh, gimme a break.

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,029
I'm not good at that kind
of thing like you are.

157
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:08,758
Like I always say, the most important thing in driving technique is ``this.''

158
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:13,946
You can figure out anything
by driving behind your opponent.

159
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:18,645
From the opponent's habits and weaknesses, to how well the suspension is set up.

160
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,554
Your analysis skill is
almost monstrous{incredible}.

161
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:30,292
To me, you're incredible because you can keep up with me without thinking.

162
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:34,750
If you can apply theories to your driving skill, it's ideal.

163
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,740
I was defeated the other day because of unfamiliarity and carelessness.

164
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,638
I've never had such
a disgrace before.

165
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,678
The inside of that Eight-Six
must be monstrous.

166
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:46,098
Monstrous, huh ?

167
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,817
I'm getting interested.

168
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,055
Maybe I should watch
the race tomorrow.

169
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,132
Takumi !

170
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:07,982
Saturday has
finally come !

171
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,540
So what ?

172
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,220
What do you mean,
``So what ?''

173
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,690
The race !

174
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,179
The race against
the Akagi Redsuns !

175
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:20,488
You promised me you'd borrow the Eight-Six and we'd go see it together.

176
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:24,237
Oh, speaking of which...

177
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,257
Things are getting
complicated.

178
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,286
What is it ?

179
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:33,295
Don't even say
that you can't go.

180
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:36,434
Well, it's not that, but...

181
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:40,522
If you cancel, I won't be seeing you anymore, no matter what the reason is.

182
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:45,631
I've kept counting the
days to go until today.

183
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,981
I know.

184
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:48,881
Excuse me.

185
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,509
I want fried tofu.

186
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,179
Oh, you again.

187
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,049
You're so persistent.

188
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:00,377
Mr. Fujiwara, please come
to the race today.

189
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:03,906
I might be
able to go.

190
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:11,574
I said, I might be able to go to tonight's race on Mt. Akina.

191
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:14,094
Really ?!

192
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:17,183
My neck...

193
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,952
Hey, are you alright ?

194
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,051
Are you really coming ?

195
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,071
I can't say
it's definite...

196
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:28,399
...but the chance
is fifty-fifty.

197
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,829
When's it gonna start ?

198
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:32,618
The friendship rally
begins at 9:00...

199
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:34,358
...and the time attack
begins at 10:00.

200
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,468
Ten o'clock...

201
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:41,776
If the Eight-Six doesn't
appear by ten, give up on me.

202
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,125
Then you'll have to
do something yourself.

203
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,615
I'll be waiting,
Mr. Fujiwara.

204
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:49,084
I believe that
you'll definitely come.

205
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,093
I'm not sure.
I said fifty percent.

206
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:55,283
No, you've already
decided to come.

207
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:58,321
I'll be waiting for you,
along with all the team members.

208
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:03,390
Well then, Mr. Fujiwara, I'll be waiting at Akina's peak at 10:00.

209
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,175
I can't help myself when it comes to an eager guy like him.

210
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:23,995
If Takumi refuses,
should I drive myself ?

211
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:27,433
Boy, I'm getting excited.

212
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,947
Something good happened ?

213
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:56,036
You're acting a little
different than usual.

214
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,935
Am I ?

215
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,544
I'm always like this.

216
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,824
You look happy
for some reason.

217
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:07,092
Actually, I'm going to the beach with my friend tomorrow.

218
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,832
I'm really looking
forward to it.

219
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:11,112
Friend, you mean a guy ?

220
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,541
No, it's a
girl of course.

221
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:21,299
If that's what it is, I can buy you a new bathing suit at the department store.

222
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,589
It's alright.

223
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,937
I bought myself one already.
I don't need two.

224
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:29,167
I want to see you
in the bathing suit.

225
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,386
That's strange.

226
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:33,136
You've seen
everything.

227
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:34,566
You're a pervert.

228
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:37,984
I wonder if it'll
be sunny tomorrow.

229
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,584
Don't ask such
a dumb question.

230
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,733
It'll be sunny all
over the country.

231
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,093
Are you going somewhere ?

232
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,582
I'm going
to the beach.

233
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,031
Beach ?

234
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,611
Say what ?!

235
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:54,750
I'm so envious !
I wanna go to the beach, too !

236
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,229
Don't tell me...

237
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:59,438
...you're going with a girl !
Is a girl going with you ?!

238
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,508
Yeah.

239
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:03,578
Who is it ?!
Do I know her ?!

240
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,626
Is she cute ?!
Does she have big boobs ?!

241
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,126
Really cute.

242
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:12,725
Mogi Natsuki...?

243
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,605
Yeah.

244
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,913
You're so cruel,
going ahead of me.

245
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:21,323
Sorry, but the situation didn't give me a chance to ask.

246
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,942
Some other time, okay ?

247
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:25,621
Don't cry.

248
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:31,380
What's gonna happen
during the race today ?

249
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,288
I heard that the Redsuns have won every race they've challenged.

250
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:38,488
The outcome is
so obvious.

251
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:40,977
The Akina team will
be totally nailed.

252
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:44,167
But the fastest in
Gunma aren't the Redsuns...

253
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,635
...but us, the
Night Kids of Myogi.

254
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,245
Takeshi, it's about time.

255
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,665
Alright, let's go.

256
00:14:54,173 --> 00:15:00,812
The R32 is a pure thoroughbred,
born to run fast.

257
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,482
It'll never be defeated by the rotary potatoes of Akagi.

258
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,559
Incredible.

259
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,878
There's gonna be a little
party on the mountain.

260
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,207
The story about the race
between Iketani's team...

261
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:23,605
...and the fastest team on Akagi,
has been talked about everywhere.

262
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,504
I wonder which
side's gonna win.

263
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:34,672
Well, Takumi's Eight-Six is Bunta's car as well...

264
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,292
...so it won't
be defeated.

265
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:40,031
I'm getting excited
after such a long time.

266
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,318
There're so many people !

267
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,447
I've never seen such big
galleries on Akina before.

268
00:15:56,447 --> 00:16:00,556
The Redsuns drew them here
to show off their speed.

269
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:04,334
It'll be so disgraceful
if we lose.

270
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:07,254
By the way, about the Eight-Six you talked about earlier...

271
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:09,033
Is that really true, Iketani ?

272
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,373
Yeah.

273
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:14,492
It's so hard for me
to believe in that Eight-Six.

274
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:19,051
I heard that Takahashi's FD3S~~is moderately tuned for the mountain path.

275
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:23,329
Still, they say it
produces at least 350 HP.

276
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,259
It's got so much power.

277
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,328
Even if it's downhill, the
Eight-Six will be no match for it !

278
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:33,086
Iketani, did you get hit
somewhere really bad ?

279
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:37,266
Even if it's the Eight-Six,
it's not a normal Eight-Six.

280
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:41,685
Takahashi Keisuke himself said that it looked like a normal panda Trueno...

281
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:45,143
...but it's a monster
machine under the skin.

282
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:49,133
Trust me.
He'll come for us.

283
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,331
If he doesn't...?

284
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,980
The galleries
are so big...

285
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,880
...and I don't want them to say the Speedstars ran away...

286
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:02,958
In that case...

287
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,878
In that case...

288
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:09,457
Kenji, for the sake of the team, you drive like hell to win !

289
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,345
Y...you must be kidding...

290
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,324
Many cars are coming up.

291
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,994
I hear the rotary
sound also.

292
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,562
The Redsuns !

293
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,880
There they are !
The Redsuns !

294
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,899
They've finally arrived.

295
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,014
The Takahashi brothers are
incredibly popular.

296
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:02,082
They're the sons of a doctor who runs a big clinic in Takasaki.

297
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,012
We can't compete
with the rich.

298
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:10,640
Driving skill depends on how much gas and tires are wasted.

299
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,057
What the hell
is Takumi doing ?

300
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,107
The race is gonna begin !

301
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:25,506
Even though I made sure,
that stupid Takumi...!

302
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,896
Idiot, jerk !
You're not my friend !

303
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:31,974
Ouch !

304
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:35,823
I won't be able to make it in time.
I'd better go on my scooter.

305
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:39,802
Let's start the time
attack at 10:00 as planned.

306
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:44,481
If it's late, there'll be no other traffic, making it easier.

307
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:48,740
We'll use radios at the start and finish to time them.

308
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,848
We'll put officials at the blind corners, so the drivers can go as fast as they want.

309
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:59,426
If there's oncoming traffic, we'll
use lights to signal the drivers.

310
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:00,696
I see.

311
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:02,836
They seem so experienced.

312
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:06,465
Yeah, I guess they do time attacks in many places.

313
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:11,863
Well then, it's gonna be a free run till 10:00, so let's have fun.

314
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,883
The galleries
are packed.

315
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,698
The Eight-Six isn't here.

316
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:32,198
What's going on ?

317
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:35,867
Are they going to hide their secret weapon until the last moment ?

318
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,986
It's the bottom of the ninth, one out,
with the bases loaded.

319
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:42,575
What is it ?
Have you decided to go ?

320
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:45,285
I don't feel
like it though...

321
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,564
Why not ?~~Don't you have the confidence to win ?

322
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:49,953
If you drive like you
always do, you won't lose.

323
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,780
There it is !
It's Keisuke's FD3S~~!

324
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,055
Incredible !
The entry speed was so fast !

325
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:21,644
That's Takahashi
Ryosuke this time !

326
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,314
Watch out !
Move !

327
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,679
Just like Takahashi Ryosuke.
His skill is the real thing.

328
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:55,666
Incredible !~~They don't
hit at that distance ?

329
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:58,014
That's the famous
parallel drift !

330
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,813
It's a difficult
one to approach.

331
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:08,701
It can't be done without the skill to control your speed and line during a drift.

332
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,831
But that's only
a performance.

333
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,610
They drive differently
when they race.

334
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:34,145
The ghost of Akina
hasn't arrived.

335
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:36,424
You're my only opponent.

336
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,543
Come out, Eight-Six !

337
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,500
Aren't you giving
me a paper cup ?

338
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,708
You don't need one, because you're not carrying tofu.

339
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,857
It's not for a
delivery, so have fun.

340
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:05,157
Full tank of gas.
Don't forget.

341
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,346
I know.

342
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:09,245
