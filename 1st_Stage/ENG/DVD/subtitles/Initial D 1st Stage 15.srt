Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:04,869
Let's dive into the brand new trip.

16
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,594

Yo! Here we go unknown world he to

...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,400
That's our law.

31
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,470
Don't blame me.

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,073
The Eight-Six of Akina will simply turn to scraps of metal in a junkyard.

33
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,332
Now I'm pissed.

34
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:34,664
He did that on purpose.

35
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:39,349
I won't lose to a lowlife like you, no matter what !

36
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:50,500
Angry Takumi's Maniacal Drive !

37
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,623
Watch out !

38
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,137
He didn't mind
hitting the guardrail !

39
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:47,361
And he used the reaction
to initiate his drift !

40
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,332
What's that Eight-Six
driver thinking ?!

41
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:22,848
No way.

42
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,650
The Eight-Six is
gaining on me.

43
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,162
That's impossible !

44
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,533
Is he trying to
kill himself, or what ?

45
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,996
That Eight-Six driver
has gone nuts.

46
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:44,871
If an ordinary
driver gets angry...

47
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:48,224
...he'll keep making mistakes and won't be able to run fast.

48
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,469
But he's different.

49
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:57,234
His natural driving sense allows him to push the Eight-Six to its limit.

50
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,938
The angrier he gets,
the faster he drives.

51
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:05,082
The result of this
race is obvious, Shingo.

52
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,493
Shit...

53
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:19,497
Although I'm pushing
my EG6 to the limit...

54
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,810
How could this
be happening ?

55
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,343
It's strange{scary}.

56
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:37,687
I've never been so afraid of attacking the downhill before.

57
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:02,954
He's on my tail !

58
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,626
I don't believe this.

59
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:09,160
The EG6 is the best of its class, but it's being pushed hard by an Eight-Six.

60
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,204
It has nothing to do with being fast or slow, it's fundamentally different.

61
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,257
That Eight-Six
is a monster.

62
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:19,039
But I'll be fine as long as
I don't let him overtake me.

63
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,684
After I clear the five hairpin curves, the finish is near.

64
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:24,015
This battle is mine.

65
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,055
I won't let you
take the inside.

66
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,032
Is he going to
hit me this time ?

67
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:44,698
Dammit.

68
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:57,010
I thought he was
going to hit me...

69
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,393
...but what was that
cornering just now ?

70
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:02,366
He stayed inside at full speed,
and passed me so easily.

71
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,161
How could
I be overtaken ?

72
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,345
I don't get it !

73
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,866
Will Takumi be alright ?

74
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,812
I don't think we have
to worry anymore.

75
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:32,297
We've come this far, so he must've figured out this death match.

76
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:35,932
He might have pulled
away from that EG6.

77
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:41,517
If so, that annoying jerk from the Night Kids must be sweating a lot.

78
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,059
Yeah.

79
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:47,965
He might be regretting
challenging Takumi already.

80
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,564
I dragged him into
this gumtape death match.

81
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:10,257
If I lose, I'll be the
laughingstock of the team.

82
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:14,441
I'll keep my reputation by
ending this race with a tie.

83
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:20,578
The power of my B16A will make our cars run side by side in this short straightaway.

84
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:22,350
You can't get away.

85
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,252
The end of this battle...

86
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,035
...will be a
double crash !

87
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,588
One's coming.
Which one ?

88
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,720
It's gotta
be the EG6.

89
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,365
The Eight-Six ?!

90
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,308
W...what's that
Eight-Six's problem ?

91
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,350
He almost killed me.
What happened ?

92
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,193
The EG6 isn't coming.

93
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,565
What happened
to Shingo ?

94
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:59,002
{Hageshii yume jikan sae mo ima koeteku}The raging dream goes beyond time now.

95
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:03,097
{Rage your dream, kaze no naka de mabushiku}Rage your dream, shining bright in the wind...

96
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:07,030
{...sakebu anata yumetachi to}...you shout with your dream.

97
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,155
{Rage your dream. kodou tomaru kurai ni}Rage your dream.
It almost stops my heartbeat.

98
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:15,420
{I can feel. Tsuyoku kanjiteru}I can feel it so strongly.

99
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,083
{Rage your dream yami wo harisaite iku}Rage your dream to break through the darkness.

100
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,256
Like a stream to the peak.

101
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:27,042
{Sekai juu no kogoekitta yoru wo keshiteku}It will eliminate the frozen night.

102
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:31,055
{Rage your dream michi wo hiraiteku}Rage your dream to explore the road.

103
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,829
Di-ding dang another round, never slow down.

104
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,654
My EG6...

105
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,423
Could that be Takumi ?!

106
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,153
No.

107
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:56,493
You lost it ?

108
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,036
You're lucky the
damage isn't too severe.

109
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,819
Hey, are you alright ?
Any injuries ?

110
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:08,826
Get in my car.

111
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,589
I'll take you
to the hospital.

112
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,952
It's quicker than
calling an ambulance.

113
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:21,289
You don't have
to do that much.

114
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,942
Just make a phone call.

115
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:29,957
Don't be stubborn.
It hurts, doesn't it ?

116
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,901
When we have an accident, we're supposed to help each other.

117
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,154
We're locals, so we know
an emergency hospital.

118
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:40,659
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

119
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,763
He's incredible.

120
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,026
Who the hell is that
Eight-Six driver ?

121
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:08,829
Takumi, Takumi !

122
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,961
Are you awake ?!
Come down here !

123
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:14,946
What ?

124
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,590
I'm awake,
'cause it's that time.

125
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,391
Just come down, quick !

126
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,769
So, what're those ?

127
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,894
You must've hit
the car somewhere.

128
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:36,228
There are three scratches that look like the kind made by touching the guardrail.

129
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,920
I don't remember anything.

130
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,872
It must've been you.

131
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:45,027
I didn't drive it yesterday,
so it was you !

132
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:48,221
Look at those scratches
on the bumper and fender !

133
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:51,383
It's true.
How terrible.

134
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:52,755
Who did that ?

135
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,498
You did !

136
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:57,710
Ouch.
Why'd you do that ?

137
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,405
What ?

138
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:06,230
Come to think of it, I barely remember hitting something with the car.

139
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,051
What's wrong with you ?

140
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:11,116
You're too young
to be senile.

141
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:17,462
I raced this really disgusting guy yesterday, and he pissed me off in the middle of it.

142
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:23,769
So I got really mad for some reason, but then I came home and went to bed quickly.

143
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,365
I don't know how it happened, but you aren't very good if you hit something with your car.

144
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:33,778
If it had been me, I wouldn't have hit anything, no matter what.

145
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:39,774
So, did you win ?

146
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:40,997
Yeah.

147
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,229
I see.

148
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:17,925
Is it alright
to do that, Itsuki ?

149
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,280
The examination didn't
show anything bad...

150
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,281
...so I'll be leaving
the hospital soon.

151
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:28,737
These flowers
are for you.

152
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:29,828
I'll arrange them.

153
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,690
Arigato.

154
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,146
I heard all
about it, Takumi.

155
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,989
You won the
gumtape death match.

156
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,461
Yeah.

157
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:45,695
You're incredible, Takumi !

158
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:49,508
You can handle
FR killer rules.

159
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:51,661
You're really a genius.

160
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:56,796
Itsuki, I wanted to win that battle, no matter what.

161
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:01,020
Not just because
he pissed me off...

162
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,124
...but also because
I didn't want to lose.

163
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:07,627
I've never felt
like that before.

164
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:10,881
You're becoming more
and more like a Road Racer.

165
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,004
No, it's nothing like that.

166
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:17,128
Okay, once I get out of the hospital, I'll improve my technique.

167
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:21,062
That way I won't disgrace the name of Akina's Levin/Trueno pair.

168
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,845
What're you guys
talking about ?

169
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:26,548
Oh, nothing.

170
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,630
By the way,
what about Saori ?

171
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,392
Is she doing fine ?
Is she alright ?

172
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,206
Yeah, she told me
to say hello.

173
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:36,048
Oh, really ?

174
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:40,262
Okay, once I'm out of the hospital, let's all go driving together again.

175
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,073
Sure.

176
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:41,963
Yeah.

177
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,900
It's good to know
that Itsuki's fine.

178
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,971
Yeah.

179
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:52,374
And his Eight-Five
will be returned soon.

180
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:55,448
I lied to
him a little.

181
00:15:55,979 --> 00:16:00,673
Saori told me that she was really scared when the accident happened.

182
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:04,667
She doesn't want to remember that moment, so...

183
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:15,349
So, even though she knows Itsuki's a nice guy, she wants to leave things behind.

184
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:21,025
Saori won't
come after all.

185
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,461
Dammit !

186
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,944
Road Racers don't
need a girl !

187
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,850
Hey, what's up ?

188
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:51,948
I'm gonna take the car to a body shop, but
I wanted to see your aged face before that.

189
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:55,641
Takumi hit the
car really hard.

190
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,965
But in that race,
it was unavoidable.

191
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,547
That idiot.

192
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,259
But it's a good sign.

193
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,401
You're acting strange.

194
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:08,014
Your car's fender is dented
and you're still smiling.

195
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,657
His driving
style changed.

196
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:14,992
He was good, but
he lacked something.

197
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,265
He's trying
to drive fast.

198
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:20,377
He broke through a wall.

199
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,629
How do you know, Bunta ?

200
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:25,323
I know because I look
at the Eight-Six every day.

201
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:29,026
I can see how
he drives so well.

202
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,770
Is that so ?

203
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:40,028
I'll stop by on the way home, so let's have a drink later, Yuichi.

204
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:40,408
See ya.

205
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,840
Bye.

206
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:54,063
A crazy son and
a crazy father.

207
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,065
He hasn't
changed a bit.

208
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:32,283
I couldn't help
stopping the car.

209
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:39,841
I don't have any dirty thoughts,
but I can't leave her alone.

210
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:06,430
Well, I...I don't want you
to think I'm suspicious.

211
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,672
I'm just curious about
what happened to your car.

212
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:13,186
I don't really
know what happened.

213
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,941
I tried starting it many times,
but the engine won't start.

214
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:19,923
If you don't mind,
I'll take a look.

215
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,726
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

216
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:26,210
In cases like this, it's
probably an electrical problem.

217
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,231
Let's see...

218
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,460
S13...

219
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,162
Speedstars...?

220
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,827
Can you fix it ?

221
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:44,869
Yeah.

222
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:58,535
Man, I've never been so close to a woman other than my mom.

223
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,437
Oh no, my heart's
gonna burst.

224
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,220
She's ultra cute.

225
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:13,400
Smells nice.

226
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,813
I'm smelling a babe for
the first time in my life.

227
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:22,500
Oh no, what if
I smell of sweat...?!

228
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,425
Okay, I think
it'll run.

229
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,887
Start the motor.

230
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:45,744
Alright.

231
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:48,826
It started !
Great !

232
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:53,242
Thank you very much.
You really saved me.

233
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:56,806
It was nothing.

234
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:58,897
That's not true.

235
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:02,822
I admire people who
are good with machines.

236
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:05,454
I'll make it
up to you later.

237
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:07,447
How can
I contact you ?

238
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,361
It's okay.~~You don't
have to worry about it.

239
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,303
I see.

240
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:16,215
Damn !

241
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:20,451
This could be the only chance God will give me in my entire life.

242
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,576
I'm an idiot !

243
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,579
Stupid, moron !
I'm such an idiot !

244
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,350
Ummm, excuse me.

245
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,595
Here.

246
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,940
I'm Sato Mako.

247
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,941
Please call me.

248
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:51,923
Mune ni nokoru nanigenai kotoba dakega
Only casual words remained in my heart.

249
00:21:51,923 --> 00:22:01,024
Mayoi michi wo nukeru basho shitteita
I knew the place to free me from my delusion.

250
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:09,572
Anata ni deatta hi kara nanika ga kawarihajimete
Something started to change since the day I met you.

251
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:13,427
Itsushika koko ni tatteita
I realized that I kept standing here.

252
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:17,380
That's for your love.
This isn't a dream.

253
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:25,990
Omoide ni kaeru hodo tsuyoi wake ja nai kedo
It wasn't a memory so strong to recall.

254
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,042

When we got close...

255
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:43,938

Being tired of love, I wandered around...

00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:39,009
I lost my heart
to your beauty !

272
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,562
Hey, Iketani,
what happened ?

273
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,784
I can't live without you.

274
00:24:42,784 --> 00:24:46,848
Are you a queen or an
angel who fills my heart ?

275
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,461
It's no use.~~He's completely
