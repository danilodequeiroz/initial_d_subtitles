Let's move into the brand new world.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,140

Trip to the world.

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,610
Yo! Here we go unknown world he to

Kimeru took dake bashitto
Get things done right, only when needed.

26
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,030

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,330
...toki ni chuusyou toka mo nai wake ja nai kedo

Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,640
That's our law.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
No oncoming traffic.
Let's show off, Mako !

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Go !

33
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,670
Im...impossible.

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,650
We knew that the Eight-Six was extraordinary from the beginning.

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,200
I decided this race
would be the last.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,730
So unless we try our best,
I won't be satisfied !

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,820
How can you have
gotten so timid ?

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,400
You're the worst !~~You're like baggage in the passenger seat !

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,250
Baggage ?

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes, you're only ballast, worsening the power to weight ratio.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,450
She's one of those who changes their personality behind the wheel.

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,480
How can you
call me ballast ?

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,740
I've got a nice body,
and I'm not chubby or fat !

44
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,210
But you're a
49 kg handicap !

45
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,300
47 kg !

46
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,400
Now that you've said that,
I can't stay quiet.

47
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,620
Let's do it, Mako !
Drive like hell !

48
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,230
That's more like it.{what I wanted.}

49
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,830
Turn hard, as if you were going to hit the cliff in the next corner.

50
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,930
Okay, Sayuki.

51
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,850
Race-Settling Super Drift

52
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,040
Well, good night, Papa.

53
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,850
Yeah.

54
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,350
Natsuki...

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,990
...when will
I see you again ?

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,390
I don't know, since school
starts again soon.

57
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,700
Natsuki...

58
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,520
Next corner is sandy,
so stay on the inner edge.

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,550
Okay, Sayuki.

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,980
No oncoming car.

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,460
Drift in the
next corner.

62
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,430
I was distracted by the car behind me and I couldn't drive at my own pace.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,390
Somewhere in my mind, I thought no one could keep up with us.

64
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,890
But I realize now...

65
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,710
There's no way I can drive fast if I watch my rear.

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,140
I won't look in the mirror again.

67
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,290
Skid here.

68
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,170
There shouldn't be
many more corners.

69
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,330
I wonder if Takumi
is keeping up with her.

70
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,470
Honestly speaking, I thought
they'd come back right away.

71
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,850
It'll be okay.

72
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,390
Even if he can't overtake them,
he'll outrun them in the second heat.

73
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,340
How could he possibly
overtake them ?

74
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,050
I don't know how
he can keep up.

75
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,390
He chose to be the pursuer on
a course he's never driven.

76
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,500
It started. Great.

77
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm Sato Mako.
Call me.

78
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,870
I'm very sorry.

79
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,850
For my memory
of this summer...

80
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,480
...would you let me race against Akina's Eight-Six on the Usui mountain pass ?

81
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,210
That's my wish.

82
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,610
If you make my
wish come true...

83
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,550
...you can have
my virginity.

84
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,560
Iketani...

85
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,380
What ?

86
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,850
How come you
look out of it ?

87
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,850
You must be
thinking about Mako.

88
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,550
It shows on your face.

89
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,870
I...I'm not...

90
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,070
You don't have to lie.

91
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,760
Mako is a nice girl.
I agree with you.

92
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,450
Kenji...

93
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,540
I don't know what happened, but you should go after her again after this battle.

94
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,080
She's too good to
give up on so easily.

95
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,060
It's okay.

96
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,880
Drift here.

97
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,060
A car's coming, but you'll pass it in the third corner...

98
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,950
...so don't worry now
and go full throttle.

99
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,110
Okay, Sayuki.

100
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,720
Next one,
the car'll appear.

101
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,220
Some people are racing.

102
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,350
I want to see.

103
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,050
You can tell how good they are by watching how they drive the downhill.

104
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,020
I...incredible...

105
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,710
Bingo.

106
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,960
Sayuki never misses
oncoming cars.

107
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,710
She never misses the headlights, which reflect off the leaves several corners away.

108
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,250
Grip !~~Get close
to the inside !

109
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,520
Great, Mako.
This is more like you.

110
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,630
Drift all the
way and clear it.

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,670
No oncoming car,
so drift.

112
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,310
Incredible.
She's dangerously good.

113
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,410
Skilled Road Racers always keep a slight margin of safety.

114
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,190
They appear to be
driving at the limit...

115
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,090
...but they use the full gripping potential of the tires only at the exits.

116
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,750
They save the tires when braking and at the turn-in.

117
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,850
Because one mistake means crashing on the street with no escape zone.

118
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
But...

119
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
...she doesn't have
that margin right now.

120
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,420
Her tension is so high
that she hasn't noticed it.

121
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,200
I wonder if I should tell
her about it or not.

122
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,730
It's my role
to tell her, but...

123
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,460
I've decided...

124
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,200
I shouldn't disturb her while she's driving so well.

125
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,210
I've made up my mind.

126
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,050
We're the best partners, so I'll believe in your skill, Mako.

127
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,100
You're driving better
than ever before.

128
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,640
Damn, what an entry.

129
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,190
She increased her pace.

130
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,490
If she goes any faster,
I'll reach my limit first.

131
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,780
Even now, I'm using the
full potential of the tires.

132
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,490
Damn, I can't...?

133
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,290
Wings of fire, tsubasa ni koi no honoo nosete
Wings of fire. We let our wings carry our passion for love.

134
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,670
Higher.

135
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,710
Wings of fire jiyuu ni hateshinaku takaku tobu
Wings of fire. We fly high so freely.

136
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,520
Koe wo kiku dakede kimochi ga ochitsuku
I feel relieved just by hearing your voice.

137
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,860
Fudangi no futari ga naniyori mo uresii yo
We appreciate each other for unchanged behavior.

138
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,160
Togireta rail no ue samayoi tsuzuketeta hibi mo
There were days we wandered on a broken rail.

139
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,490
Kotae wa mabusikatta kesshite te wo hanasanai
The answer seemed so bright, and we'll never let our holding hands go.

140
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,770
Wings of fire, tsubasa ni koi no honoo nosete
Wings of fire. We let our wings carry our passion for love.

141
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,000
Higher.

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,840
Wings of fire, jyuu ni hateshinaku takaku tobu
Wings of fire. We fly high so freely.

143
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,620
Wings of fire, futari wa speed ageteyuku
Wings of fire. The two of us pick up speed.
**************
If you can't outrun him, there'll be no place to settle the race.

144
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,130
I know.

145
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,040
Wings of fire, hirogaru kono sora wo kakemeguru
Wings of fire. We fly around in the open sky.
**************
No oncoming car, so take
it at your best pace.

146
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,650
The Eight-Six slowed down.

147
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,500
Why ?

148
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,640
No, Mako !
Your entry speed's too fast !

149
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,620
No, you can't recover !
Just spin to stop !

150
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,850
This is bad !

151
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,300
Please, get by !

152
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,960
We're safe.

153
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,740
Splendid.

154
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,070
I admit our
total defeat.

155
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,400
He's incredible.
He's got much better range.

156
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,830
How do you feel ?

157
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,850
Even though we lost...

158
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,470
...I'm completely satisfied.

159
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,540
I recalled those exciting feelings from when we started racing.

160
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,020
We were obsessed with
driving until daybreak.

161
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,190
The pure feeling
from those days...

162
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,710
We crossed the limit, but you
were wonderful till that moment.

163
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,590
It's the best driving
I've ever seen from you.

164
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,900
Sayuki...

165
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,700
So, I'll leave
it up to you, Mako.

166
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,600
You can do
as you like.

167
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,530
Thanks, Sayuki.

168
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,660
No, no tears.~~I'm so happy to have had a great race.

169
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,300
They're back !

170
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,730
I...I wonder how the
first heat turned out.

171
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,160
Are they going to
start the second run ?

172
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,260
Takumi !

173
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,600
Takumi, I can't believe
this myself, but...

174
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,680
There won't be a second
heat, will there, Takumi ?

175
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,290
No second run.
Once was enough.

176
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,200
I thought so.

177
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,450
Even though
it was Takumi...

178
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:35,850
No, I didn't want
to see Takumi lose.

179
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,190
We lost.

180
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,440
W...what did you say ?

181
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,980
What did you just say ?

182
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,120
Don't make me say
that we lost again.

183
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,150
He won.

184
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,100
He did it !

185
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,850
He did it !

186
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,750
Honestly speaking, we didn't think we could lose on our home course.

187
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,530
I just kept following you
so I wouldn't get outrun...

188
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,910
...so I don't
think I won.

189
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,300
You don't have
to be so modest.

190
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,580
You should be proud of yourself, because you have such wonderful skill.

191
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,470
But...

192
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,250
We've driven here so often,
we were very confident.

193
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,500
But we couldn't
outrun a visitor.

194
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,350
So that means we
lost, right, Mako ?

195
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,620
Mako...

196
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,290
It was a wonderful race.
Thank you.

197
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,700
He's so shy.

198
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,810
He's strange.

199
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:26,300
He's totally superior in controlling a car,
but he's so reserved in other things.

200
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,530
He's like this all the time.
He acts so stupid.

201
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,280
Almost like he's always asleep,
except for driving a car.

202
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,160
How can you say that ?

203
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,030
It's true.

204
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:43,200
But how can you be
so good at your age ?

205
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,450
Why don't you go after her again, after the race ?~~She's too good to give up on so easily.

206
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,090
Iketani.

207
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,980
T...thanks for tonight.

208
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,190
Mako, I...I...

209
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,800
Iketani, don't
be depressed.

210
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,050
Road Racers don't
need a girl, right ?

211
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,030
R...right.

212
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,520
When I look closely, he's got
my favorite kind of cute face.

213
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,410
Hey, what's your name ?

214
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,590
Fujiwara Takumi...

215
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,820
Takumi and I'm Itsuki.
Eighteen years old.

216
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,980
My sign is Leo, and my blood type is O.  My favorite car is...

217
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,400
I'm not asking you.

218
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,740
By the way, why don't we go to the pool together for friendship ?

219
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,780
Sounds good, sounds good.

220
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,230
Kenji...?

221
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,730
You'll go, right, Takumi ?!

222
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,800
And you of
course, Iketani ?!

223
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,290
Great !

224
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,320
Thank you
so much, Sayuki !

225
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,020
It's a promise !

226
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,280
This is great !
I'll go in my Eight-Five !

227
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,980
Ai ni tsukarehate samayotte ta koro
Being tired of love, I wandered around...

Kiseki no hana yo

242
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,150
Iketani, you have to
be true to yourself.

243
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,440
Otherwise, humanity would've
been extinct by now.

244
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,020
You're right, Manager.

245
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,460
But the first time is very important.
For the first time, don't...

246
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,120
Oh...dear ?
I'm just leaving.

247
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,500
Are you going home, Manager ?

248
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,200
What did you mean by
``For the first time, don't...?''
