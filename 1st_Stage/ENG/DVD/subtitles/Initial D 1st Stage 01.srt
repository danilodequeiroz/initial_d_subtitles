Before we suffocate, let's yell. Ho !!!

Let's move into the brand new world.

Let's dive into the brand new trip.

18
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:04,758

00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:20,709
1,300,000 yen~($13,000)
for a 1991 model.

36
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,815
As I thought,
the S13 is expensive.

37
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:28,262
It's the Eight-Six after all.
It's more realistic.

38
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:32,028
The car has to be F/R,
right, Takumi ?

39
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:32,967
Takumi ?

40
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,053
Hey, are you listening ?

41
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,002
I am, Itsuki.

42
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:41,298
So, how much is
that Eight-Six thing ?

43
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:43,845
Well, there's one
for 300,000~($3000).

44
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:45,044
It needs the
tag though.

45
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,342
And how much do you
have saved so far ?

46
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:49,230
A little
over 50,000~($500).

47
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,298
Long way to go.

48
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:58,600
Where can I find a
good job for quick money ?

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,428
Even if I work full time this summer at the station we're at...

50
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,675
...I can only earn
120,000~($1200) at most.

51
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:06,303
I wonder if I can
find a better paying job.

52
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,589
You guys have jobs ?

53
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,857
Mogi ?

54
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:20,638
What, is it so surprising
for me to talk to you ?

55
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:21,857
Not really.

56
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:25,003
120,000 for full time
during the summer ?

57
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:27,370
How long do you
work a day ?

58
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,768
From the morning
until the night.

59
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:34,334
You work that hard, and you only earn 120,000 a month ?

60
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,902
That's a ballpark figure.

61
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:39,289
Pay's really low
for high school students.

62
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:44,733
I didn't know.
I've never had a job.

63
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,777
Work hard, okay ?

64
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:53,924
Let's go out together
when finals are over, okay ?

65
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:54,923
Yeah !

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,168
She just said
``go out together,'' didn't she ?

67
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,098
Yeah.

68
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,287
With Mogi ?

69
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:04,783
Cool, cool !

70
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:07,360
Takumi, why didn't
you tell me ?

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,108
You should've told
me that you knew her.

72
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:13,204
It's been almost a year
since I last talked to her.

73
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,802
We were in the same club...

74
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:18,888
...so we used to talk often,
until last summer.

75
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:22,344
What're you talking about ?
It doesn't matter anymore.

76
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:23,993
Mogi Natsuki, huh ?

77
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:25,942
What a nice turn
in the story.

78
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,958
My eyes can't help
following her. She's so cute.

79
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,980
Takumi ?!

80
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,909
Hey, Takumi !

81
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,128
You look out of it !

82
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,384
We've gotta hurry !
We have a grammar test !

83
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,403
H...hey !

84
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,137
Say, why don't we buy
an Eight-Six together ?

85
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:52,794
If we combine our pay,
we can pay the loan.

86
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:54,312
I don't want to.

87
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,759
Why do you want
a car so badly ?

88
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,357
Your family has one,
don't they ?

89
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,855
It's no good.

90
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:04,452
My dad's car is automatic
and front wheel drive.

91
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:07,009
And the engine is diesel.

92
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,937
It sucks.
It's not even a car.{Hiro agrees.}

93
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:15,600
If it runs on four tires,
it's a car.

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,498
You don't know anything.

95
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:21,574
If it's not enjoyable on the mountain passes, I don't call it a car.

96
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,562
What do you do on
the mountain passes ?

97
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:25,180
It's so obvious.

98
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,388
Tackle the corners.

99
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,057
The corners ?

100
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,715
Is it fun
doing that ?

101
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,482
Of course.

102
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:38,427
You're a man, and you don't want to tackle the corners on the mountain passes ?

103
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:41,784
I'm tired of that
kind of thing.

104
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,062
What do you mean ?

105
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:46,798
We just got our
licenses last month.

106
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,389
You're pretty.

107
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,457
You look best
in your uniform.

108
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,385
Do I ?

109
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:10,894
Thank you, Papa.

110
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,395
Papa, my schoolmate
has a job.

111
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:27,287
Even if he works throughout the summer, he'll only earn 120,000 or so.

112
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:30,114
Well, that's
about right.

113
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:34,529
I guess it's hard
to earn money.

114
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:40,064
I receive 300,000~($3000) a month by only seeing you three times.

115
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:43,360
Is it alright
to get that much ?

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,447
It's alright,
because you're worth it.

117
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,383
Is it ?
I don't know.

118
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:56,188
Thank you very much.

119
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,215
Thank you very much.
~~~~~~~Thank you very much.

120
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:03,410
Hey, Takumi, think about
the Eight-Six, okay ?

121
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,038
Forget about
the Eight-Six.

122
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,163
You guys have good taste,
looking at an Eight-Six.

123
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,970
Right, right, right ?

124
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,268
You think so,
too, Iketani ?

125
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,985
Yeah, the Eight-Six
is a good car.

126
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,364
See ?

127
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:24,818
Well, to tell the truth, I don't know anything about the Eight-Six.

128
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,927
Who makes it ?

129
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:30,842
Are you serious, Takumi ?
Wanna drink some high octane ?

130
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:35,258
It's pitiful for someone working at a gas station not to know about the Eight-Six.

131
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,925
Well, I guess it
can't be helped.

132
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:42,490
When you guys were in 3rd or 4th grade,
the 92 was already available.

133
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,207
There's an old car we use
for work, at my place.

134
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,934
Don't compare
it with that !

135
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:51,152
Even if it's old,
the Eight-Six is different !

136
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:54,468
If I bought an Eight-Six,
could I join your team ?

137
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,674
I've been dreaming of joining the Akina Speedstars.

138
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,123
Sure.

139
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:04,188
By the way, it's Saturday, so people will be gathering on Mt. Akina tonight.

140
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,507
You wanna come along ?

141
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,115
Can we ?

142
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,602
But we don't
have a car.

143
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,789
I'll give
you a ride.

144
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,833
In your S13 ?

145
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,842
I will, I will !
I'll definitely go !

146
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:23,339
You're going, right, Takumi ?~~We don't
get a chance like this very often !

147
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,008
Yahoo, I'll join the Speedstars !

148
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:26,445
Yahoo, I'll join the Speedstars !
{OverLap}I didn't say I was going.

149
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:27,444
{OverLap}I didn't say I was going.

150
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,658
We're leaving !

151
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,725
Alright, and I'll pick you up at the bus station at 8:00pm !

152
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:37,664
Okay !

153
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:42,029
You're really into it.~~Which mountain pass are you going to ?

154
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,734
Manager, Mt. Akina is the
only place to drive around here.

155
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:50,790
Our team is proud of being
the fastest on Mt. Akina.

156
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,337
There are many guys who proclaim themselves the fastest on Mt. Akina.

157
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,365
When I was
actively driving...

158
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:59,742
...there was a guy everyone knew
was the fastest on Mt. Akina.

159
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:03,747
And he's still
driving on Mt. Akina.

160
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:05,385
Even now ?

161
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:11,109
I know most of the people driving on Mt. Akina,
but I don't know anyone that old.

162
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:14,707
He doesn't drive
at the same time you do.

163
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:18,393
He's an old guy,
who runs a tofu shop.

164
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,775
He delivers tofu to the hotel by Akina Lake around 4:00am.

165
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:28,662
His speed on the downhill
is well worth watching.

166
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:32,428
He has to drive in rain and snow, because it's his job.

167
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:37,373
If it's Akina, he knows everything,
even the stains on the asphalt.

168
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:41,019
I bet the fastest
on Mt. Akina...

169
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,678
...is the Eight-Six
from a tofu shop.

170
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:44,865
The Eight-Six from
a tofu shop ?

171
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,525
Are you going out, Takumi ?

172
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:57,283
Yeah, I'm supposed to
meet with Itsuki.

173
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't mind you
staying out late...

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,979
...but I'll beat you until you wake up in the morning.

175
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,517
I know. You don't
have to tell me.

176
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,825
Well, I'm leaving.

177
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:26,043
Shut up, Takumi !
You'll disturb Iketani !

178
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:29,829
Even if you say so,
what's scary is scary !

179
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:30,968
It can't be helped.

180
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:34,165
Everyone's scared when
riding with a Road Racer.{speedster, road racer, whatever appropriate.}

181
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,543
Next, it's a hairpin
curve in 2nd gear.

182
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,593
Shut up, Takumi !

183
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,298
Alright, I'll push a
little harder tonight.

184
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:54,184
Okay, let's go
full tilt.

185
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,830
Are you alright, Takumi ?

186
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,088
I didn't expect
you to be so scared...

187
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,535
...so I pushed hard without
worrying about you.

188
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,062
You're such a wimp !
You're so uncool !

189
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:10,828
You must be one of those people who screams on a roller coaster !

190
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:14,524
I've never thought a
roller coaster was scary.

191
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,522
It's not like that.

192
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:21,817
Itsuki, you wouldn't
understand this fear...

193
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,264
...even if I explained
it to you.

194
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,898
I've never seen
them before.

195
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:42,904
Are they heading for
Mt. Akina this early ?

196
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:46,840
Something might be
happening at the peak.

197
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,777
Never seen them before.

198
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:13,863
Redsuns...?

199
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,440
Are they the Redsuns,
the fastest on Akagi ?

200
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:45,710
We're the members of the Akagi Redsuns Team.

201
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,948
I hate to ask this
so abruptly, but...

202
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:53,373
...if you know any team or driver who's the fastest on this mountain, let us know.

203
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,252
Is he serious ?

204
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,460
It should be us.

205
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,367
We're the Akina
Speedstars Team...

206
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,634
...and we consider
ourselves the fastest here.

207
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,692
That makes it easy.

208
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:09,457
Would you like to hold a ``gathering'' with the Akagi Redsuns on this mountain ?

209
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,148
Wow, it's gonna
be a cool scene !

210
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,795
What do you say ?

211
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:23,073
It's boring, always driving
against people you know.

212
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:26,828
It's exciting to drive
with other teams.

213
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:29,685
You can make new friends,
and exchange information.

214
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,933
It'll help improve both
of our skill levels.

215
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,782
We'll drive along for a while,
then pick one from each team...

216
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:37,248
...and race uphill and
downhill at the end.

217
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:42,463
We're not concerned about winning or losing, just friendship between teams.

218
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:43,692
How does it sound ?

219
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,728
If that's what it is, we don't have any reason to decline.

220
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:47,877
Nope.

221
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:51,313
How does next Saturday
at 10:00pm sound ?

222
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:52,992
Okay, fine.

223
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,908
Then we'll drive as much
as we can today.

224
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,235
This is awesome,
so awesome, Takumi !

225
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,383
We don't have to hold back !
Let's get going !

226
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:12,212
Okay !

227
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,738
Iketani...

228
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:30,933
Let me see how the Takahashi brothers, the fastest on Akagi, drive.

229
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,542
Takahashi brothers...?

230
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,719
Do you mean they're the super famous Takahashi brothers...

231
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,478
...the ones who were
covered in the magazine ?

232
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,944
Yeah, people call them the
Takahashi brothers of the rotary engine.

233
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,189
Iketani, what about us ?

234
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:48,365
Sorry, but I drive alone
when I drive seriously.

235
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,703
Wait here,
I'll pick you up later.

236
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,690
I feel left out !

237
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,537
Why are we the only ones
who don't have a car ?

238
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,434
Hey, Itsuki...

239
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:12,660
...is it so fun to
be a Road Racer ?

240
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:18,105
Why do they get so excited
about such a thing ?

241
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,163
I'm the one
who has to wonder.

242
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:23,619
Hearing the sounds of cars
being pushed to the limit...

243
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:27,795
...don't you get
excited, Takumi ?

244
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,134
Excited...

245
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,218
Yes, Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

246
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:37,445
Oh, it's you, Yuichi.

247
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,443
What's with the call
in the middle of the night ?

248
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:41,400
``It's you''
you said ?

249
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,598
It's been a while,
and you sound so cold.

250
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,544
I passed you coming
back from your delivery.

251
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:51,330
I flashed my lights,
but you ignored me.

252
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,028
No, that wasn't me.

253
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,595
It had to be, because the car was your Eight-Six.

254
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,322
Well, actually...

255
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:04,218
It was probably my car,
but I wasn't driving.

256
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:07,354
My son, Takumi, is delivering
tofu to the hotel now.

257
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,270
S...say what ?!

258
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,258
S...since when ?

259
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,057
Five years ago.

260
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,265
``Five years ago...?''

261
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:18,213
When he was only 7th grade ?
\C5(Note:  Japan's legal driving age is 18.)

262
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:38,992
Dammit,
I can't keep up.

263
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:45,985
They're fast.

264
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:49,900
I'm pushing myself to the limit, and I can't catch any of the Redsuns.

265
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,890
What do you think, Brother ?

266
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,469
They're pathetic.

267
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:04,277
Even our second stringers
could beat them.

268
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:06,814
We don't have to send
our best next week.

269
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:08,183
I'll pass on it.

270
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:10,809
If you won't,
then I'll pass, too.

271
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:12,718
No, you should drive.

272
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,724
Leave a course record that the local guys can never beat.

273
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:20,989
Otherwise, the name of the Akagi Redsuns won't become legend.

274
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:26,943
For starters, we'll rewrite every course record in this prefecture.

275
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,269
Soon, we'll do the same in Saitama, Kanagawa, Tokyo, and Chiba.

276
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:37,323
We'll be legendary Road Racers, leaving the fastest records in the Kanto area, then retire.

277
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:41,948
That's the Akagi Redsuns'
``Fastest in Kanto Project.''

278
00:18:55,944 --> 00:19:00,559
Incredible.  They're
fundamentally different.

279
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,734
It's so shocking to be outrun
by outsiders on our home ground.

280
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:09,210
They've spent a lot of money on their suspension, and they've got power, too.

281
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,738
It's impossible to compete
with the Redsuns.

282
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:14,524
But the local people
can't run away !

283
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:17,282
Right.  Since we said
``yes,'' we have to !

284
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,319
But you can't beat
them with just guts.

285
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,837
Well, that's...
But...

286
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:28,230
It's getting late, so let's find a place to talk about this tomorrow.

287
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,905
Road Racers
hate defeat.

288
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,782
So when it comes to racing,
we tend to become overly stubborn.

289
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:42,017
Nothing could be worse than being defeated by outsiders on our home ground.

290
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:45,643
It's like the code
of the Road Racer.

291
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,780
Hey, where's Ryosuke ?

292
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,098
He went home
a long time ago.

293
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,475
We're the only
ones still here.

294
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:04,733
It'll be dawn soon.

295
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:07,310
Let's go home.

296
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,175
They can't keep up with
me if I drive seriously ?

297
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:23,834
They aren't so good.

298
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,068
There's somebody.

299
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:38,549
It's not from our team.
Is it an MR2 or a 180 ?

300
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:55,822
Fine.~~You won't be in my mirror after two more corners.

301
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,173
An Eight-Six ?!

302
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:14,272
No fucking way !

303
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:38,697
My FD can't outrun
an obsolete Eight-Six ?

304
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,345
Am I having a
bad dream or what ?

305
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:41,434
Shit !

306
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:45,070
I'm number two
in the Akagi Redsuns !

307
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,333
He doesn't know
what's ahead ?

308
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,980
After this slow right-hander, there's a tight left corner.

309
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,088
If he doesn't slow down, he'll end up at the bottom of the ravine.

310
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:03,822
As I thought.
He's going too fast.

311
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,319
He doesn't have enough room
to recover and slow down.

312
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,632
W...what the hell...?

313
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,398
Inertia drift ?!

314
00:22:42,672 --> 00:22:45,139
My pride says "You gotta be wild and tough."
