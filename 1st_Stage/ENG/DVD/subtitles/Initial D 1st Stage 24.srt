00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,320
Kogoeta machi ni giniro shita kemuri...

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,020
...misugita yume no daisyou.

Accel funde gomakasu.

Yoru ni kowareta mama shisen tsuyoku togarasete.

Dareno kimagure kara sekai sae mo owarisoude.

7
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,120
"Break in 2 the nite" It's that time.

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,700
Obieta me wo shite lost in the night.

9
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,360
Ochiteku yume ni dakareru.

...kitto sunao ni naresou.

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,680
Yo, Takumi !

17
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,560
You look sleepy.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,740
It's my nature.

19
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,490
Hey, it's time.

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,270
For the battle against
Takahashi Ryosuke.

21
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,150
I'm looking forward to it so much that I can't concentrate on studying.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,050
He's the fastest in Gunma.

23
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,170
And Takahashi Ryosuke's very
popular with the girls !

24
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,340
Hey, Takumi, do you
have a plan ?

25
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,670
Not really.

26
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not that smart that I can change strategies according to my opponent.

27
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,670
It's the same every time.

28
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,510
I'll just drive the
fastest way I know how.

29
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,200
If he's faster
than that, I lose...

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
...and if he's
slower, I win.

31
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,760
That's true.

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,900
But I'm counting on you.

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,000
If you defeat
Takahashi Ryosuke...

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,420
...you'll be great !
It's so cool, isn't it ?!

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm so lame.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,800
The White Comet of Akagi !

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,660
Welcome !

38
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,850
Oh, Kenji.

39
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,140
I've got something
interesting.

40
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,650
Interesting ?

41
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,650
Could that be that rare
adult video you have ?

42
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,720
Sorry, it's not.
It's even more exciting.

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,350
More exciting ?

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,700
It's a battle.

45
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,850
It doesn't look like Akina.

46
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,230
Just keep watching.

47
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,580
Hey, let me see
that part again, slower.

48
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,430
I...it's Takahashi Ryosuke !

49
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,140
He looks
a lot younger.

50
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,750
It's a battle from
three years ago.

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,530
How did you get this ?

52
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,150
An enthusiast took
a few videos.

53
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,020
Incredible !

54
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at that sharp turn-in.
It's the work of a god.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,330
Awesome.

56
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,650
I was in the
gallery at this battle.

57
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,320
It's so nostalgic.

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,630
Takahashi Ryosuke didn't belong to any team then, and he drove alone.

59
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,420
He was called the
White Comet of Akagi.

60
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,050
``The White Comet of Akagi...?''

61
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,210
Sounds so cool.
I'm getting excited.

62
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,260
Then, what about the Redsuns ?

63
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:37,160
He formed the Akagi Redsuns later,
by gathering highly skilled drivers.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,300
So they're all high level, and different from a group of friends like us.

65
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,150
Today, after adding his brother, Keisuke, they became known as the Takahashi Brothers.

66
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,290
But the ``White Comet of Akagi''
still sounds right to me.

67
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,980
What're you guys watching ?

68
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,190
Turn the video off.

70
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,970
No, it's alright.
Let's take a look.

71
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,900
It's incredible.

72
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,130
Takumi is racing
against those guys ?

73
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,030
Yes.

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,350
The galleries will be completely packed at the next battle.

75
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,150
Naturally, because
of Takahashi Ryosuke...

76
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,050
...but also because Takumi is famous as the driver of Akina's Eight-Six.

77
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,250
Right.

78
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,720
He's the mysterious downhill specialist
who appeared so suddenly on Akina.

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,390
Something like that,
and it's so exciting.

80
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,880
Who do you
think will win ?

81
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,650
Well ?

82
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,490
I'm sorry to say this, but I honestly don't think Takumi has a chance of winning.

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,020
He's got a tough
opponent this time.

84
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,950
I think so too.

85
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,920
Takahashi Ryosuke is fast.
Ultra fast.

86
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,160
Is he that fast ?

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,400
Yeah, he was way out of our
league even three years ago.

88
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,480
And he's improved his
skills since then.

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,200
Not only on
the mountain passes...

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,150
...but he's also continuously winning in autocross and circuit racing.

91
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,370
He's rewritten many course records,
and he hasn't been defeated.

92
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,740
His undefeated legend
hasn't been ruined yet.

93
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,480
And they say there hasn't been a race that's made him drive seriously yet.

94
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,820
They say that he can defeat any opponent with just half his skill.

95
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:38,190
So no one has seen
him driving at his limit.

96
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,920
Well, if Takumi can keep up
with him, that'll be enough.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,330
No...

98
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,980
Here you go with the
pessimistic thoughts again.{There you go with those negative waves again.}

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,700
Why can't you
be more optimistic ?

100
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,880
Then, who do you
think will win ?

101
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,790
T...Takumi defeated his brother, Keisuke,
and the Night Kids' Nakazato !

102
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,900
He defeated the
Sil-Eighty on Usui !

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,520
He also won the gumtape death
match and the rain battle !

104
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,270
I...I think
he can compete.

105
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,640
Ryosuke even outclasses the rest of the highly skilled Redsuns.

106
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,400
He's charismatic.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
He's not on the same level
as Keisuke or Nakazato.

108
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,060
Well, if it were a boxing match, the betting would be ten to one, I guess.

109
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,690
I want Takumi to win.

110
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,250
Not only because
he's my friend...

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:46,050
...but also I want my dream car,
the Eight-Six, to outrun the FC !

112
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,270
Don't cry.

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,070
Guys like cars,
don't they ?

114
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,410
Yeah.

115
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,760
Are they that great ?

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,700
They are. I can
go anywhere I want.

117
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,320
If you were told to choose between your girlfriend and a car, which would you choose ?

118
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,450
I can't compare them.

119
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,310
A girl is a girl,
and cars are cars.

120
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,630
Driving a car
is difficult.

121
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,100
Lately, I've been thinking more about how to drive faster.

122
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,630
I feel good when
I think about it.

123
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,500
Takumi, you're...

124
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,930
...perverted.

125
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,650
What do you mean, saying that I'm perverted so suddenly ?

126
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,250
Sorry, I just felt like it.
It's girl's intuition.

127
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,250
But now I know.

128
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,680
I feel like I know the
secret of your charm.

129
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,350
W...what're you talking about ?
You're not making sense.

130
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,350
It's alright. I don't
think you'd understand.

131
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,000
Geez.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,790
When's the battle ?

133
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,580
The night after tomorrow.

134
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,560
You're going to race against
a very fast person, right ?

135
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,050
Yes.

136
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,600
I want to
see you race.

137
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,890
But I'd better not.

138
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,300
Just don't have an accident.

139
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,340
You can lose, but
don't have an accident.

140
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,480
No matter what.
Promise me ?

141
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,650
Hey, Ryosuke, there's another professional team asking you to join.

142
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,470
They contacted me.

143
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,200
Another one ?
Cool.

144
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,630
Which one ?

145
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,250
That famous
Hoshiya Racing Team.

146
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,660
They're looking for a
promising young driver.

147
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,900
They say they want to see you as soon as possible...

148
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,140
...so they're asking you
to contact them soon.

149
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,650
You'd be very competitive
in professional racing.

150
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,780
I'm excited
just imagining it.

151
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,700
What're you going
to do, Brother ?

152
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,040
Please decline.

153
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,240
As I said before, I have no intention of becoming a professional driver.

154
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,250
You deserve it.

155
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,330
Why don't you at
least listen to them ?

156
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,840
He's right, Ryosuke.

157
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,970
I'm not interested
in professional racing.

158
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,930
Street racing is more interesting because anyone can race freely.

159
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:05,670
To me, autocross and circuit driving are only processes for mastering the street.

160
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,490
All I care about now is the
Eight-Six this coming Saturday.

161
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,550
Hey, you're closed, right ?
Why don't you come for a drive ?

162
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,490
With you ?

163
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,520
Yeah.

164
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,620
I changed the suspension settings, so I'm going to take it for a test spin.

165
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,650
Take a test spin...?

166
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,260
I don't like the
way you say that.

167
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,560
Hey, Bunta...

168
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,900
Yeah.

169
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,010
Did you change the suspension settings to win the next battle ?

170
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,650
Sort of.

171
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,670
Yuichi, I'm gonna
push it a little.

172
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,610
W...wait.

173
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,300
Okay, but just
for a little.

174
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,600
Here it is.
Here comes the corner.

175
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,050
Incredible entry speed.

176
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,850
Geez, I feel the side G
force from a little aft.

177
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,300
Hey, y...you idiot !

178
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,680
Bunta, what're you doing ?

179
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,050
Well, I feel
like a smoke.

180
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
S...stop !

181
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,890
How can you look away ?!

182
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,340
No.

183
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,010
Not bad...

184
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,810
Okay, now I'm gonna
drive seriously.

185
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,420
Let me out !

186
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,390
The engine and suspension tune-ups for winning the next battle are complete.

187
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,170
How much is
it making, Brother ?

188
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,310
Well, it's about
260 horsepower at max.

189
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,650
260 horsepower ?

190
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,850
That means it's
been detuned.

191
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,320
I believe you
had at least 350 hp.

192
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,220
Correct.

193
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,300
You lowered the power.

194
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,500
What's the point
of making it slower ?

195
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,590
You'd better
remember this.

196
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,480
In order to drive fast, sometimes you have to lower the power.

197
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,000
That's the difficulty
of street racing.

198
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,180
The key to mastering the
downhill is total balance.

199
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,560
I tuned my FC to have total balance for both downhill and uphill.

200
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,830
Because I had confidence in handling big power on the downhill...

201
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,250
...I changed the turbine,
and increased the pressure.

202
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,650
But now, I have
to lower the power.

203
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,710
For whatever the reason, this detune is disgraceful for me.

204
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,740
Even if I lose my pride,
I still have to win.

205
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,330
Which means Akina's Eight-Six is that fast, doesn't it ?

206
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm glad to have met someone who can make me feel this way.

207
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,000
After such a long time, my
Road Racer blood is boiling.

208
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,210
Follow me.

209
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,800
He's fast.

210
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,070
Although he lowered the power, the exit speed is definitely faster.

211
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,890
He won't lose.
No way he will.

212
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,760
I'm not the Redsuns'
Takahashi Ryosuke now...

213
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,250
...I'm the solo driver, the
White Comet of Akagi...

214
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,370
...Takahashi Ryosuke.

215
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,820
I'll win the battle
no matter what.

216
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,860
Takumi !

217
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,910
Hey !

218
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,680
Race day's here.

219
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,850
Yeah.

220
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:06,270
I'm frustrated, because everyone says that Takahashi Ryosuke will win.

221
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,060
It's like a match between a champion sumo wrestler and a neophyte.

222
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,310
Aren't you frustrated ?

223
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,160
Don't you have a secret plan
to turn the situation around ?

224
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
``Secret plan...?''

225
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,150
Nope.

226
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,590
Road Racers are heading
for the mountain.

227
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,570
It's time.

228
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,000
Manager.

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,500
I've cleaned the outside,
so let me call it a day.

230
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,810
Okay, good work. You're going to see the battle tonight, right ?

231
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,150
Yes.

232
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,950
Do you still think
Takumi will lose ?

233
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,160
Yes.

234
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,220
Even if Takumi's a genius,
he's only a high school kid.

235
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,150
He hasn't experienced
that many battles.

236
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,960
I wonder how long he can keep up with Takahashi Ryosuke.

237
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,300
I disagree.

238
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,400
I think he might
be able to win.

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,820
Why ?

240
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,260
Because...

241
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,690
Yo.

242
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,450
We're in a hurry,
so excuse us.

243
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,450
Okay.

244
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,520
I have only one reason for thinking that he might be able to win.

245
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,340
Takumi is Bunta's son.

246
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,340
That crazy Bunta.

247
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,460
As I thought, the
galleries are packed.

248
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,770
If I were Takumi,
I'd run away.

249
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,490
I'd be so nervous if I had to race in front of so many people.

250
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,010
That's Usui's Sil-Eighty.

251
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,300
As I thought...

252
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,190
They're both
pretty nice...

253
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,860
Yeah.

254
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,530
Let's see...
I think this is the place.

255
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,370
We should be able to see the battle in a combination of corners.

256
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,600
By the way, Mako...

257
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,230
...which one are
you rooting for ?

258
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,300
Which one...?

259
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,650
The Eight-Six, isn't it ?

260
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,710
Me too.

261
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,400
That Eight-Six has
a mysterious charm.

262
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,190
The charm that can only be felt by those who've raced with him.

263
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,990
Even if you lose, you still
want to support him.

264
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,030
Besides, he's...

265
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,700
...so cute, right ?

266
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,280
Oh, Sayuki.

267
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,590
It's almost 9:30.
It's almost time.

268
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm so excited !

269
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,940
Here come the Redsuns.

270
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,900
That's the Takahashi Brothers !
They're so cool !

271
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Yeah, the king
of the streets !

272
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,970
Ryosuke !

273
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,540
Finally, Takahashi
Ryosuke has appeared.

274
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,220
When Takumi appears,
the cast will be complete.

275
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,410
The Eight-Six
isn't here yet.

276
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,240
As usual.

277
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,640
He always shows up at
the very last moment.

278
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,300
Keisuke, I've been thinking
about this for a while.

279
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,200
If I lose on
the street...

280
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,820
...I'll retire.

281
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,020
What're you talking about ?
You won't lose.

282
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,070
Just listen.

283
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,380
That doesn't mean
I'll stop driving.

284
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,090
I'll withdraw from
being top driver.

285
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,930
I'll still be involved with the team in a different way.

286
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,670
What about the Redsun's project
to be the fastest in Kanto ?

287
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,840
If you don't drive,
it'll be impossible.

288
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,250
Don't make such
a pathetic face.

289
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,970
I haven't lost yet.

290
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,200
But I want you to know that there'll be a time for a new generation to take over.

291
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Someday, I'll lose
to someone.

292
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Now that I've said that...

293
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,000
...I can say that I've met two drivers who might defeat me.

294
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,620
One of them
is you, Keisuke.

295
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,350
Me ?

296
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,380
Yes.~~I can sense a
promising talent in you.

297
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,000
You will definitely get faster.

298
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,300
And the other is...

299
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,110
He's come !
Takumi's here !

300
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,370
Hey, Takumi !

301
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,130
Brother, could the other be
the Eight-Six driver ?

302
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,500
I haven't lost
to anyone yet.

303
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,810
Tonight, I'll drive,
drifting at full throttle.

What's wrong, Takumi ?

320
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,260
I've been racing because
the situation called for it.

321
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,480
This time, I feel like
it's a little different.

322
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,650
I'm so excited, but
I don't know what to do.

323
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,650
It's fun and
interesting to drive.

324
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,400
Anyway, I don't know how much I can do, but I want to try my best.

325
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,800
He's different from the usual Takumi.
Anyway, I don't know how much I can do, but I want to try my best.

326
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,900
Takumi is hyped up !
Anyway, I don't know how much I can do, but I want to try my best.

327
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,300
