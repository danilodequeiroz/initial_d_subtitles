Suji dake wa toosite ikiteru
...and lead at least a rational life.

30
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:30,771
That's our law.

31
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,106
A car with good straightaway
speed is following me.

32
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,454
Why don't
I wait for him ?

33
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,297
An R32 GT-R ?

34
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:08,544
Let me see how
good it runs.

35
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,558
Fine with me,
that's what I want.

36
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:52,887
A New Challenger

37
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,616
Is this place alright ?

38
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:58,663
I'm fine.  My house is
just around the corner.

39
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:04,547
You said this car is
dorky, but I like it.

40
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,832
It's lively,
small and cute.

41
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:09,521
What's it called ?

42
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,699
Trueno.

43
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,368
A Trueno...

44
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,575
Let me ride in
the Trueno again.

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,847
It was fun today, Takumi.

46
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:24,746
Bye-bye.
I'll call you again.

47
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,448
Cute, she said.
What do you think ?

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,687
I can keep up
with Takahashi Ryosuke.

49
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:55,934
The GT-R is
unbeatable after all.

50
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:04,055
No matter how good the driver is,
I guess that's the best a dated FC can do.

51
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:21,377
I'm Takahashi Ryosuke,
a member of the Redsuns.

52
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,676
I know.

53
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,704
I'm Nakazato Takeshi.

54
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:27,621
I'm with the team in
Myogi called the Night Kids.

55
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:30,148
Nakazato Takeshi of
the Night Kids...?

56
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:33,335
The fastest downhill
Road Racer on Myogi.

57
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:38,171
I'm honored to be known by a super star like Takahashi Ryosuke.

58
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,386
But the Night Kids'
Nakazato I heard of...

59
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,783
...was driving an S13.

60
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,677
Well, whatever.

61
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,534
And what is a Road Racer
from Myogi doing on Akina ?

62
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:56,771
Hey, come on.
What about you ?

63
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,467
You're from Akagi, and I know we're here for the same reason.

64
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:07,521
I came here to see the
Eight-Six I saw yesterday.

65
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,675
A 32 driver is going to
challenge the Eight-Six ?

66
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,453
With a 32 tuned to 380 HP ?

67
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:17,360
How...?

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,606
I can tell by the exhaust sound on the straightaway and power.

69
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:25,443
But the outcome's
pretty obvious.

70
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:28,680
The Eight-Six is no match
for the 32 on the uphill...

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,954
...and you can't defeat the Eight-Six with your 32 on the downhill.

72
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,632
Say what ?

73
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:38,939
My 32 can't beat the
Eight-Six on the downhill ?

74
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,325
Don't be offended.~~I'm just telling you my opinion.

75
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,560
You sound pathetic.

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,377
You don't have to be so hesitant just because your brother was defeated.

77
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:52,584
It's only an Eight-Six.

78
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,381
You'll find out
if you race him...

79
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,690
...that only
I can defeat him.

80
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,855
Don't mess with me.  Having said that, I won't back down.

81
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:05,142
I'll defeat the Eight-Six,
and make you eat your words.

82
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,869
Your confidence
won't last long !

83
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:11,196
Don't forget about
Nakazato of Myogi !

84
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:15,372
You'll learn that the rotary is no match for the 32 !

85
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:32,104
...was driving an S13.

86
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:36,649
That's right,
I changed at that moment.

87
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:55,371
Damn, I can't pass him,
no matter how hard I try !

88
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,058
Even if I close in on the corner,
he pulls away on the straightaway.

89
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:01,544
My technique as a
Road Racer is better !

90
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:02,604
Damn, I won't lose !

91
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:33,022
I can't keep up with
a 32 with this car ?

92
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:39,176
The best of Myogi can't defeat
a 32, which doesn't even drift ?

93
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,402
A car has
its limits.

94
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:48,147
No matter how good the driver is,
it won't run beyond its capabilities...

95
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:50,274
...even if it's the Eight-Six.

96
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,994
Good morning.

97
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,092
Yo.

98
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,041
Here, Iketani.

99
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,709
What's that ?

100
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,328
Fried tofu.

101
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:11,023
We had some left from yesterday,
so Dad told me to give it to you.

102
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,132
I see.

103
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:13,840
I'll put it
in the fridge.

104
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,227
He's concerned about me.

105
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,433
By the way, Takumi...

106
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,608
Is it true that you've been delivering tofu to the hotel by Akina Lake for five years ?

107
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,197
Yeah.

108
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:31,882
You're so secretive.
You could've told me.

109
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:36,508
I couldn't talk about it openly.
I would've gotten in trouble.

110
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:38,895
T...that's true.

111
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:44,260
We were only middle school
freshmen five years ago.

112
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,164
So you've been driving
longer than me.

113
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:56,227
Every day on Akina, whether it's raining or snowing, since middle school.

114
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:59,624
It was early morning,
so nobody saw me...

115
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,422
That's not what
I'm talking about...

116
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:04,149
...but weren't you scared
of those corners ?

117
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,666
I was scared
in the beginning...

118
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,713
...but my fear was gone
after six months or so.

119
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:14,509
As I picked up the speed, the tires would naturally start skidding...

120
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:18,964
...and it took me another six months until I could skid and stop as I like.

121
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:22,910
So you mastered the downhill
in only a year ?!

122
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,465
When you do it everyday,
you get used to skidding.

123
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:31,991
So I try to get as close
as I can to the guardrails.

124
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,538
Ordinary people don't
do such dangerous things !

125
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:37,186
I never thought
it was dangerous...

126
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:40,232
...and when I'm in a good mood,
I can get as close as 1 cm.

127
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,279
One centimeter...?!

128
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,841
It's really boring work unless
I find something interesting to do.

129
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:55,477
I've never thought about improving my driving techniques.

130
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:59,104
It's tiring, and I just wanna get home as fast as I can...

131
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:03,419
...so I drive as fast as possible on the way home since I'm not carrying tofu.

132
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,865
Takumi, can I ask
you something ?

133
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:09,473
How do you drive
when you carry tofu ?

134
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:12,450
If you drive too rough, you'll damage the tofu, won't you ?

135
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,946
I can't drive that
fast on the way up.

136
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:21,990
Dad puts water in a paper cup,
and I put it in the cup holder.

137
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,615
If I don't spill the water, I won't damage the tofu, even if I drive fast.

138
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:32,029
It's pretty difficult.

139
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,186
In the beginning, I spilled
a lot even when I drove slowly.

140
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,475
Makes sense.

141
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:39,772
Brakes, steering wheel,
gears and the gas pedal...

142
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,049
If I'm too rough with any of those, I spill the water.

143
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:47,104
Dad told me to rotate
the water in the cup.

144
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,411
Rotate the water
in the cup...?

145
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:53,578
I think it's got something to
do with surface tension.

146
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:56,575
The water rotates extremely close to the edge of the cup.

147
00:10:57,554 --> 00:11:03,098
I rotate the water in
every curve when climbing.

148
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:09,532
It took me a while to
drift without spilling the water.

149
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:13,027
Drift without spilling it ?!
Can you do that ?

150
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,183
Don't lie to us, Takumi !
You're just joking, right ?!

151
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,897
The most important factor in
driving is shifting the weight.

152
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:27,532
The drift king, Tsuchiya Keiichi,
said the same thing.

153
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:34,306
In order not to spill the water in the cup, he had to learn extremely delicate weight shifting.

154
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,463
Especially if it's drift...

155
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,850
No one can do that !

156
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,729
I'm not lying.

157
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:45,254
Just because you defeated Takahashi Keisuke, don't get overconfident !

158
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,463
As far as I'm concerned...

159
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:48,351
A customer.

160
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,950
Welcome.

161
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,897
High octane.
Yes, sir.

162
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:59,859
He's incredible, Bunta.  He'll go beyond being a mountain Road Racer.

163
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:01,948
Thank you very much.

164
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:08,262
Takumi, I want to
ask you a favor.

165
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:11,549
Can you give me a ride,
and drive hard on Akina ?

166
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:30,489
You're going to use the car
at this time of night ?

167
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:32,656
I can't, can I.

168
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,735
It's okay, 'cause it's
not very important.

169
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:35,753
I don't mind.

170
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,002
Are you sure ?

171
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:41,897
Don't you need the car to
go to a meeting or something ?

172
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:46,143
You'd better think
about it some more.

173
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:49,988
What's the matter ?  You sound like you WANT me to have something to do.

174
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:52,895
It's not that, but...

175
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:57,871
Then go ahead and use it, but come pick me up at the meeting place.

176
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,178
So you do
have a meeting.

177
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,016
I'm getting
really excited.

178
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:15,793
It's like riding one of those scream machines in a theme park.

179
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:19,928
Damn, I'm so envious.

180
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:23,055
I don't think
it'll be that fun.

181
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:24,794
I'm ready, Iketani.

182
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:28,149
Okay, Takumi.
Push it to the limit.

183
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,378
Move away, guys.

184
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:37,730
It makes a
wonderful sound.

185
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,646
You can never hear
that from a turbo.

186
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:55,982
Here comes the
first corner.

187
00:13:55,982 --> 00:14:00,088
I'd better pay close attention to see the difference, and steal his technique.

188
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,363
H...hey.

189
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:03,923
Hey !

190
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,562
Takumi, the brakes !

191
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:15,141
How...how's he controlling the car in this situation ?!

192
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:17,600
What's going on ?
Is this really a car ?

193
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:21,795
Incredible.

194
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,539
It's ringing
at this point ?!

195
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,346
That means he's already
going beyond 100 km/h ?!

196
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,033
The next corner
is coming up !

197
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,187
Hey, the Eight-Six
is coming back.

198
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:12,793
I wonder why.  It's too soon if he went to the base of the mountain.

199
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,391
He passed out.

200
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,578
Takumi...

201
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:30,935
...how many corners ?

202
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,882
T...three...?

203
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,917
I witnessed the incident !

204
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:42,463
On the frightening Mt. Akina downhill
where a scream echoes...

205
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,710
...of Iketani in
the third corner...

206
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,807
...passing out !

207
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,804
I guess he's for real.

208
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:54,101
Manager, why're you here ?

209
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,296
Well, I was
a little curious.

210
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:01,173
I guess I'm
out of place.

211
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:07,907
Please, enjoy.

212
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,683
I've heard of him.

213
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:15,988
Nakazato of the Night Kids
is unbeatable on Myogi.

214
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:20,324
I don't trust the skill
of 32 drivers.

215
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,122
Only the car is fast.

216
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,341
Is that so ?

217
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:24,729
You don't think so, Brother ?

218
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,466
Here comes Keisuke's
hatred of the 32.

219
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:30,763
But, Ryosuke...

220
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,760
...I don't think it's a good idea for Nakazato to go ahead of us.

221
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,494
If the Night Kids defeat the Eight-Six we couldn't defeat...

222
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:44,890
...people will start thinking our skills are less than the Night Kids.

223
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:51,222
That's how a rumor spreads, and I think that's Nakazato's intention.

224
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:54,149
I don't think
we have to worry.

225
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:58,565
Nobody in the Night Kids can defeat that Eight-Six.

226
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:02,692
As long as they race on Akina's downhill, no one can defeat him.

227
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,559
Nobody but my brother
can defeat him.

228
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,273
That Eight-Six is
so good and fast.

229
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:13,530
I don't get it.

230
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,415
Why can't the latest high powered car defeat the Eight-Six ?

231
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,251
Sometimes, having too much
power is a disadvantage.

232
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,355
The turbo power is a welcome
aid on the straightaway...

233
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,352
...but it disturbs the control of the car when exiting a corner.

234
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,160
It's like a
double-edged sword.

235
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,247
In the case of
the Eight-Six...

236
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:38,594
...once the line is determined, it can go fast as the driver demands.

237
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:41,341
In a technical course, where
the straightaways are short...

238
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:44,958
...an underpowered car can
run at its full potential.

239
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:49,404
So the turbo power of Keisuke's car worked negatively.

240
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,029
On Akina's downhill...

241
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:58,325
...the total time for using
my 350 HP maximum was very limited.

242
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:05,017
As soon as it boosted
to max, I had to brake.

243
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,714
It was really frustrating.

244
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:13,250
That's the characteristic of the FR, which only uses the rear tires to transmit the power.

245
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,658
Hey, wait.

246
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:17,714
What about a
4WD like the 32 ?

247
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:21,851
With ATTESA E-TS system, which provides stable traction during acceleration...

248
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,296
...it can use the full potential of its turbo power, can't it ?

249
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:29,642
Nakazato might defeat the
Eight-Six with his 32.

250
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,294
Thank you very much !

251
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,383
Welcome !

252
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:51,639
But I feel strange.

253
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,266
The way I look at
you is different.

254
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,015
What do you mean ?

255
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,462
Why don't you have
another bean jam bun ?

256
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:10,151
When you eat a bun like that,
you look like your usual self.

257
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:13,737
You're just a
sleepy headed moron.

258
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,135
Don't call me a moron.

259
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,584
But...

260
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:23,088
Once you sit in the driver seat of the Eight-Six and go off into the night on Akina...

261
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:26,635
Bang, squeal and boom !

262
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:31,140
You're the star Road Racer
of Akina, an admired hero !

263
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,077
Am I ?~~Really ?

264
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,096
I'm embarrassed.

265
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,563
I said not now !

266
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:41,220
You're only a moron
eating a bean jam bun !

267
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:46,284
Actually, I feel weird.

268
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,672
How ?

269
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:53,258
Not just during the race, but also when I gave Iketani a ride yesterday...

270
00:19:53,258 --> 00:20:00,240
I just drove like I normally do, but I don't understand why you guys got so excited.

271
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:06,533
I've never made
people so excited.

272
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,388
Driving is getting
more interesting.

273
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:28,572
Hey.

274
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:33,026
The black 32.

275
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:35,624
I've seen it
a lot these days.

276
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:37,991
Damn, he's
tailgating me.

277
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,130
Try not to
let it pass.

278
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,285
Okay.  The power difference is less significant on the downhill.

279
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,464
Even the Eight-Six
defeated the FD.

280
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:11,997
Small fry...

281
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:22,506
He passed us
on the outside !

282
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,864
It's almost scary. Its exit
acceleration is incomparable.

283
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:40,637
As I thought, in reality, an underpowered car can't overtake a car with a bigger engine.

284
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,449
This is an
incredible machine.

285
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:53,795
After I changed cars,
my rivals became insignificant.

286
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:59,029
I no longer had any opponent
I could take seriously.

287
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:04,463
Those showy drift plays
aren't my style.

288
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:09,768
With grip driving, I can push myself to the limit, and thrill myself.

289
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:11,865
Otherwise, I can't
be satisfied.

290
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:15,702
Come on,
Eight-Six of Akina.

291
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:20,436
I instantaneously sensed that you're good enough to be my opponent.

292
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,152
My pride says "You gatta be wild and tough."
